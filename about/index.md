## Me

I study for a PhD in Theoretical Physics at [Durham](http://www.durham.ac.uk/). I work at the [Joint Quantum Centre](http://www.jqc.org.uk). My areas of interest are atomic physics and quantum optics. I look at how we might control atoms and light to make a quantum computer.

I play piano and guitar, and write music as [Empty Set](http://emptyset.co.uk/) with my friend Dan Simons. We do short songs, often about science and love.

I run, kayak, hike, climb and every now and then leave for some place I've never gone before.

I think curiosity and persistence are what you need to be a good physicist, in fact a good most things. And 'goddamnit be kind'.

I'm not as worried as I look.

I was born in north Wales and grew up in Manchester. Both feel like home.

I got my BSc honours degree in Mathematics &amp; Physics from the [University of Warwick](http://warwick.ac.uk/) in 2004. I then worked as a graduate Electrical Engineer, designing the electrics and control software for four clean water plants in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk. I then founded a consultancy, Dinorwic, and developed software for clients including multinational companies in manufacturing and scientific services.

I always loved thinking about science, so I decided to return to solving problems of the physical world in 2009,  at the same time fulfilling a dream to move to Sweden. After two years of living in  beautiful Stockholm, I took my MSc in Computational Physics from [Stockholms Universitet](http://www.su.se/) in 2011.

I then came back to Britain to be with my girlfriend Olivia, taking a position at Durham, and here we happily are.
