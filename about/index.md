    <h1>About me</h1>

</header>

I'm reading for a PhD in Theoretical Physics at the University of Durham. I work in the Atomic & Molecular Physics group. My areas of interest are atomic physics and quantum optics. I look at how interactions and entanglement between atoms and light might be used to store and manipulate information for a quantum computer.

<aside><a class="button" href="/cv/">&rarr; Read my CV</a></aside>

<p>I received a bachelor of science honours degree in Mathematics &amp; Physics from the University of Warwick and then a master of science degree in Computational Physics from Stockholms Universitet. In between I worked as a graduate Electrical Engineer for Biwater. I worked in teams that built four clean water plants in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk. I designed the electrics and the control software.</p>

I write songs, and play guitar and piano. My friend Dan Simons and I are the folk-indie-pop group Empty Set.

<aside>I'm not currently looking for work but do mail {% include mail_dinorwic.html %} if you have an especially interesting project you'd like to talk to me about.</aside>

<p>When not doing science or music I write code professionally for clients including multinational manufacturing and scientific services companies. My primary expertise is in Oracle PL/SQL development, particularly for IFS enterprise software. For this purpose I founded Dinorwic, a limited company in England &amp; Wales.</p>

Every now and then I go on an adventure. I enjoy running, hiking, kayaking, climbing and leaving for some place Iâ€™ve never gone before.

E.M. Forster said the ideals of humanism are 'curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste and belief in the human race'. I go along with that.
