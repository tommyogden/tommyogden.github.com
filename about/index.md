    <h1>About me</h1>

</header>

I'm reading for a PhD in Theoretical Physics at the University of Durham. I study Rydberg dark states in thermal and ultracold atomic vapours for applications in quantum computing.

I have a bachelor of science honours degree in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Warwick and a master of science degree in Computational Physics from Stockholms Universitet.

For scientific computing I write C++, for less intensive tasks I favour Ruby.

<aside>I'm not currently looking for work but if you have an especially interesting project you'd like to talk to me about, mail t@dinorwic.com.</aside>

<p>Between academic work, I write code professionally for clients including multinational manufacturing and scientific services companies.
My primary expertise is in Oracle PL/SQL development, particularly for IFS enterprise software. For this purpose I founded Dinorwic, a limited company.</p>

I write songs, and play guitar and piano. My friend Dan Simons and I are the folk-indie-pop group Empty Set. You might like our album As Neat as a New Pin.

Every now and then I go for an adventure. I enjoy running, hiking, kayaking, climbing and leaving for some place I've never gone before.

<blockquote class="inset">'Curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste and belief in the human race'</blockquote>

I am a humanist. E.M. Forster said the ideals of humanism are 'curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste and belief in the human race'. I go along with that.
