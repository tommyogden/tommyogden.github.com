    <h1>About me</h1>

</header>

I'm reading for a PhD in Theoretical Physics at the [University of Durham](http://www.durham.ac.uk/). I work in the [Atomic & Molecular Physics](http://massey.dur.ac.uk/) group. My areas of interest are atomic physics and quantum optics. I look at how interactions and entanglement between atoms and light might be used to store and manipulate information for a quantum computer.

<p>I received my BSc honours degree in Mathematics &amp; Physics from the <a href='http://warwick.ac.uk/'>University of Warwick</a> in 2004 and my MSc in Computational Physics from <a href='http://www.su.se/'>Stockholms Universitet</a> in 2011.</p>

Between those degrees I worked as a graduate Electrical Engineer for [Biwater](http://www.biwater.com/). I designed the electrics and control software for four new clean water plants in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk. I then founded a consultancy, Dinorwic, and wrote Oracle code professionally for clients including multinational scientific services and manufacturing companies. 

I write music, and play guitar and piano. My friend Dan Simons and I are the folk-indie-pop group [Empty Set](http://emptyset.co.uk/). We do short songs, often about science and love.

Every now and then I go on an adventure. I enjoy running, hiking, kayaking, climbing and leaving for some place Iâ€™ve never gone before.

E.M. Forster said his ideals were 'curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste and belief in the human race'. I go along with that.
