Four years ago I went for a walk. In one go I trekked the Pennine Way over the hills of north England, from Derbyshire to Scotland. It took two weeks, I was on my own on the moors mostly, it was great.

A couple of months later I left Britain to live in Sweden. Soon after arriving, I was talking to Ida, a fellow outdoors-botherer[1], about long treks. 'You should do the Kungsleden', she said.

Kungsleden ('The King's Trail') is a 430 kilometre route across arctic Sweden, from Abisko at the top down to Hemavan through Lapland, Europe's last proper wilderness. You can hike it when the snow melt is gone in the late summer or cross-country ski it in the winter.

Yeah I should do that, I thought.

Two years later, with a PhD position and a patient girlfriend waiting for me, I left Stockholm to move to Durham. In the time I'd been in Scandinavia, between work and other things, I never dug out the time to head north and I regretted that.

February this year, over a year since I left Sweden, I found an unexpected email in my inbox. The whole message was just one short and cryptic question: 'Do you still have your backpack?' It was a good friend of mine from Stockholm, Niklas. Having mentioned the idea of Kungsleden to him a few times over beers at Carmen, I guessed what he was getting at and grinned. Yes, I still have the old pack.
 
So we're going to trek the Kungsleden. Or actually, we're not. The trail itself is 'a highway for tourists' says Nik[2]. Though it made me laugh to hear a marked-in-some-places path called a highway, I too am happy being off the beaten track. Between my time hiking around the hills of Britain and Nik's national service in the wilds of Sweden, I think we've got enough experience with a map and compass.

We're going to start at Abisko but then trek our own route through Lapland to arrive at Kvikkjokk, [X] miles away as the crow flies, which is certainly not the way we'll go. 

There'll be no farmers' fields to cross, and being able to camp anywhere we like [allmansraten], we can make our own route. The thing I love looking at the map is it's all physical.
crossing rivers, climbing hills, taking rowboats across lakes.

PW there were places along the way I could get food, and pubs to finish a day's hike with a pint. In Lapland, there'll be nobody for hundreds of miles. Just Reindeer and Elk.

[carry tent, sleeping bags, mats, stove, food] everything with us. Heavy packs. 'What animals can you hunt?'

To study the maps and plan our adventure, Nik came to Manchester a couple of weeks ago. As well as 



To plan the adventure over the maps, take me through the first draft itinerary and start an equipment list, Niklas came to Manchester a couple of weeks ago. As well as exploring the city (Marble Arch, Britons Protection, Lass O'Gowrie)

along with Science Museum and Football museum, where the embarrassingly obvious penalty shootout score was Wales 0 Sweden 3.
We even found a book in John Rylands

We also went up Kinder Scout. Taking the popular route up Jacob's Ladder, Left the path at Kinder Downfall and took a bearing. It was belting it down with rain. Worse, I'd left my walking trousers in so was wearing jeans, heavy and stuck to my legs. Nik's jacket leaked. Soaked through, both of us remained in good spirits, catching up on life and telling jokes. We stood  in the rain and drank tea. On the way down the sun came out. 'I prefer this side of the hill, it's drier'

The plan then is that at the end of July I'll fly into Arlanda, meet Niklas, and we'll take a 14-hour train to the top of Europe. Then we walk south to Kvikkjokk in two weeks, where there is a once-a-day four-hour bus that'll get us to a train station for a once-a-day return to Stockholm just in time for my flight home. If we make that, I'll tell you all about it. If we don't, we've probably been done in by bears, wolves or Santa.

[1] I found most Swedes like the outdoors, which is good as they've got loads of it.
