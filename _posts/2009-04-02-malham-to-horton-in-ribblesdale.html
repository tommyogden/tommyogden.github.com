            <p>To quote my dear Mr. Merritt, &lsquo;What a fucking lovely day!&rsquo; I was up soon after dawn, and had my sights on the white crescent of Malham Cove to the north. Just one thing puzzled me: where were the baguettes I&rsquo;d kept for breakfast? I thought back to the night: I&rsquo;d woken with a jolt… a push on the tent and a rustled bag… silence…. Fox! The thieving critter must&rsquo;ve got a paw under the tent and nabbed my petit déj. Ah well, I had some fizzy Lucozade to get me going.</p>
            <p>I scrambled up and arced along the crown of limestone pavement to joyfully admire the view back. Nobody else up and walking yet, and not a nimbus or cirrus in sight. The path led across tough grass to Malham Tarn (<img class="inline-circle" src="/images/pw-circle-a.png" alt="(A)" width="16" height="16" />), a pretty lake with a grand house on the far side, which the guide informed me had been built by Lord Ribblesdale in the late 18th century as a shooting lodge. I bet the foxes stayed away from his breakfast.</p>
            <p>Around the shore past the house, I rose again into open moorland, and hiked up an old miner&rsquo;s track to lonesome Fountain&rsquo;s Fell (<img class="inline-circle" src="/images/pw-circle-b.png" alt="(B)" width="16" height="16" />). Maintaining my high spirits, I sang Jonathan Richman over and over—sheep scarpering as I called &lsquo;whaddyasay about that, you guys?&rsquo; at them like a lunatic. Pen-y-ghent stood imposingly on the other side of the valley. After descending and crossing the road to its southern base, the unswerving incline dared me to take it on.</p>
            <p>The shelf which casts Pen-y-ghent&rsquo;s distinctive profile provided a brief breather in the vertiginous climb, though I was unusually full of energy. Once over the stile at the summit (<img class="inline-circle" src="/images/pw-circle-c.png" alt="(C)" width="16" height="16" />) the steep track actually led away from Horton, but promised to bring me there the long way round.</p>
            <p>I found a farm to camp at but no farmer, despite the alert of barking dogs. I eventually spied him at the back of a large shed full of sheep. I never understand what&rsquo;s going in these buildings, so I stood tentatively in the light of the doorway.</p>
            <blockquote><p>&lsquo;Hello! Here to camp are you? Come down that alley in the middle. That&rsquo;s it, all the way down. I&rsquo;ve got a ewe lambing here, and she isn&rsquo;t going to stop for you I&rsquo;m afraid.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>The Pen-y-ghent café further up the road looked cozy, so I stopped in for a sandwich and a tin of ginger beer. And there I saw it. Up on the shelf, among a few assorted bits of kit: a gas canister, and unmistakably the model I wanted! After six days, I&rsquo;d found my fuel. I signed their Pennine Way guestbook (only the second name of 2009) and headed excitedly back to my tent. I pulled out the stove, army tin and couscous I&rsquo;d been carrying and boiled myself up some dinner. Cooking on gas. Friendly farmer Sutcliffe walked over to enquire how the day&rsquo;s walking had gone, and where I was off to on the Friday.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;d been out of phone reception for a couple of days, so I walked back up to the red phonebox to update the folks on progress. I stopped in the Crown Inn for a pint of Black Sheep and quietly observed a village council meeting around the biggest table. I didn&rsquo;t stay long before calling it a night.</p>
