<p>The &lsquo;acorn&rsquo; logo of <a title="National Trails." href="http://www.nationaltrail.co.uk/">National Trails</a> is a brilliant piece of branding. The clear, simple ideogram that appears on the front of the guidebook I carried hundreds of miles, tucked under my waist strap, is reproduced on myriad signposts, gates, waymarks and milestones along the route.</p>
<p>Recognising this symbol, painted on a wooden board, after wandering lost for a long time on Cross Fell, gave me an immense sense of reassurance. This acorn means &lsquo;you aren&rsquo;t lost. You&rsquo;re on the right path.&rsquo; After hours wandering in poor conditions on a high fell or featureless moor, that is a most welcome message.</p>
<p>It was noticeable along the Pennine Way just how versatile the mark is: carved into wooden signs, painted on paving, embossed in plastic or chiseled onto a conspicuous rockâ€”the distinctive shape is easy to identify. In some instances a kind fellow hiker or local had drawn the mark by hand, along with an arrow pointing the way, and placed it somewhere visible to help future walkers. And it is always welcome. I can remember, on so many occasions along my journey, imploring the gods of Natural England, &lsquo;Please, give me a sign!&rsquo; They always obliged eventually.</p>
