<p>Look at that tiddler of a walk! Only 10km. Well, after four days of full-time
marching, my feet were starting to fall apart. I had a worryingly deep hole in
my right heel, and blisters on my blisters. I&rsquo;ll spare you more detail.
Thus, I had decided to take an afternoon off on Wednesday to keep them clean,
dry and rested.</p>
<p>Knowing that a shorter, flatter, sunnier walk awaited me, I felt a zillion
times cheerier than the morning before. I quickly reached the River Aire for a
tranquil waterside stroll. Baby lambs bounced about as I meandered through their
meadows—that sort of thing. I passed Airton and the big, renovated farmhouses of
Hanlith, and approached the famed destination of Malham at noon. I found Town
Head Farm to camp with splendid views of Malham Cove, and remarked to myself on
the number of hand-written, laminated signs around the place.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;No smoking. Switch lights off. Pay before pitching. Do not
leave taps running. No fires. No camping beyond this sign. No noise between 11pm
and 6am….&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I need not have feared all these regulations, as I received a friendly
welcome. The camping shop had recently closed so there was nowhere to buy gas,
the lady explained, and kindly brought me out a cup of tea—my first in three
days! I rinsed my socks in the sink and hung them out on barbed-wire to dry.
Further bylaws were posted through the afternoon; I kept checking to make sure I
remained a law-abiding, lone camper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;What network are you on? If you stand in the middle of the
main road a bit up from here you can get O2… if you&rsquo;re tall
enough.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>England were playing football later on, so I wandered down to a pub to watch
it. Finding it hard to stay awake I left soon after half-time, ready to scale
the limestone cliffs of the Cove in the morning.</p>
