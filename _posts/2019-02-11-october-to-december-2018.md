25. _Energy_ by Richard Rhodes --- An ambitious and detailed trip through 400
    years of human energy production from wood burning through coal, oil,
    petrol, nuclear and renewable energy sources, looking at innovation and the
    impact on society and the environment.

    There are some great historical notes. I thought I knew well the story of
    Stephenson's first passenger railway from here in Manchester to Liverpool,
    but there is good detail on the ingenuity of floating the tracks over the
    swamp of Chat Moss and the invested interests Stephenson fought, from canal
    owners, carriage companies and wealthy landowners. The Earl of Sefton sent
    secret death threats, letting Stephenson know he'd have him thrown in a lake
    if he persisted in taking the railway through Sefton's estates.
 
26. _A Walk in the Woods_ by Bill Bryson --- I read a bunch of Bryson's travel
    books [in 2015][2015] but put this one off partly because I knew it'd just
    put in my head the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail and that's not a
    small thing to have in your head. It's about 3,500 km long, it'd take
    months. Anyway, now I want to walk the Appalachian Trail.

27. _Worth Dying For_ by Tim Marshall --- A world tour of national flags, and
    some others. There’s a bit of history on each and some interesting facts,
    like the eight places the Stars and Stripes is authorised to fly 24 hours a
    day, how Nato HQ rotates its flags every Sunday, and that the night sky
    shown in the Brazil flag is just as it would have been observed in Rio de
    Janeiro on 15 November 1889 at the time the monarchy was taken down.

    There’s brief mentions of how flags are used to unite and divide, including
    how the St George’s Cross gets co-opted by the far right in Britain and why
    the Confederate flag is still flown in the Southern US. But mostly it’s an
    interesting light read.

    Favourite flags? [South Korea][flag-sk], [Barbados][flag-b],
    [Seychelles][flag-sey], [Brazil][flag-br], [Vietnam][flag-v]. And
    [Nepal][flag-n] because yeah, enough rectangles.

28. _Madness Visible_ by Janine di Giovanni {% include star.html %} --- I made
    trips to Slovenia and Croatia this year, both beautiful, modern EU states. I
    picked this up in a bookshop in Dubrovnik: Di Giovanni's memoir of the
    Balkan Wars, which she covered on the ground for _The Times_. It's a
    harrowing firsthand account of the devestating reality of murder, torture
    and ethnic cleansing from Sarajevo, Kosovo, Pristina. Di Giovanni avoids
    political judgements, focusing on reporting war from the perspective of its
    victims.

    It's a reminder of the extreme danger faced by war correspondents.
    Subscribe to a newspaper that pays foreign correspondents or there'll be
    nobody there to report on such atrocities.
