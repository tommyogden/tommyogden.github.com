20. _The Mixer_ by Michael Cox --- A history of the Premier League in tactics,
    this starts by emphasising how much the back pass rule changed football. It
    stopped teams (notably Liverpool) using the back pass to kill games off when
    ahead. Defenders had to improve technically and goalkeepers had to become
    footballers. More exciting, especially on television.

    Cantona changes forward play, after which every team wants a foreign,
    mercurial number 10. Most are forgettable but then there’s Zola and
    Bergkamp. Arsené Wenger arrives, asking his chairman if fans would tolerate
    two foreign players in the team. Then the sprinter-finishers, Owen and
    Anelka. Reacting, clubs now need defenders to be fast too. Vialli lines up a
    Chelsea team with no British players, it’s a global show.

    English tactics still lag European leagues, but Alex Ferguson picks it up as
    United get better in the Champions league. He not only built different
    champion teams but also derived at least three entirely different strategies
    to get ahead of the league. Arsené built the Invincibles. Later, Mourinho
    and Benitez, similar in background and in their reactive play, study hours
    of video and adapt each game to target opponents’ weaknesses. Their
    introduction in the same season lowered scoring rates in the league. Then
    possession football, false nines, inverted wingers and assisters. Finally
    the pressers, Pochettino and Klopp. Defenders had to attack, now attackers
    have to defend.

    Football is never still. As soon as a winning strategy emerges,
    counterstrategies arrive to beat it. They usually arrive from abroad. I read
    this during the World Cup. The combination might be enough to get me
    interested in football again after years of only paying attention to the
    Reds.

21. _Enlightenment Now_ by Steven Pinker {% include star.html %} --- The world
    is getting worse. Things were better in the past. The current order is
    broken and corrupt. A revolution is required. If people are hurt in that
    revolution, it’s for the greater ideological good. Facts are not facts.
    Wading through the daily swamp of Brexit, Trumpism and Corbynism it struck
    me why modern populism [seems so familiar to me][jw-wiki].

    Pinker makes an epic restatement of the case for the Enlightenment values of
    reason, science, and humanism. In the first part he takes measures of human
    wellbeing (health, wealth, safety, the environment, peace, equal rights,
    etc.) a chapter at a time and looks at the long term trends. Surprise, in
    nearly all the world there is no better time to be alive than today. Where I
    do not follow Pinker’s optimism is climate change. He doesn’t look closely
    enough at how and why the opportunity to decarbonise energy early was
    missed. The resulting climate change is already disastrous, and may well be
    catastrophic.

22. _The Looking Glass War_ by John Le Carré --- Up to the fourth Smiley novel
    now. Le Carre's world of Cold War espionage is dark, messy and
    psychological. His spies are not just fallible but self-interested and often
    mediocre. Good plot.

23. _Hackers and Painters_ by Paul Graham --- Graham is the co-founder of [Y
    Combinator][yc]. This collection of essays are from his blog so I’ve read
    some of them before. Some interesting examples are [Why Nerds are
    Unpopular][pg-nerds], [The Hundred Year Language][pg-100y] and [How to Make
    Wealth][pg-wealth]. The writing is good and editing tight, but they're
    mostly humourless. The ones on programming langauges are best. For a
    rebuttal to [the title essay][pg-hp], see that other programmer, painter and
    solid writer [Maciej Cegłowski][dabblers]. 
    
24. _Triumph of the City_ by Edward L. Glaeser {% include star.html %} --- I've
    lived most of my adult life in the centre of cities, not by accident.
    Harvard urban economist Edward Glaeser here makes the case for urban life.
    First, on the agglomeration effects that have made cities hubs of
    productivity through history.

    > Silicon Valley and Bangalore remind us that electronic interaction won’t
    make fact-to-face contact obsolete. The computer industry, more than any
    other sector, is the place where one might expect remote communication to
    replace person-to-person meetings.

    There's a chapter that looks at the decline of industrial cities, with an
    interesting observation on what made those cities vulnerable.

    > The industrial town was unlike either those old commercial cities or the
    modern capitals of the information age. Its vast factories employed hundreds
    of thousands of relatively unskilled workers. Those factories were
    self-sufficient and isolated from the world outside, except that they were
    providing the planet with vast quantities of cheap, identical products.

    Some cities have tried to build themselves back to success, which Glaeser
    argues is getting things the wrong way around. In fact, bulldozing might be
    a better, if unpopular, strategy.

    > Leipzig is worthy of emulation less for its cultural strategy than for its
    hard headed policy of accepting decline and reducing the empty housing
    stock. In 2000, one fifth of the city’s homes stock was vacant, a total of
    62,500 homes. Bulldozing vacant homes reduces the cost of city services,
    eliminates safety hazards, and turns decaying eyesores into usable space.
    Leipzig set a target of destroying 20,000 vacant units.

    The visibility of poverty in cities can give people the idea cities _cause_
    poverty but this is [wet streets cause rain][wscr] thinking.

    > Cities can be places of great inequality; they attract some of the world’s
    richest and poorest people. Although poverty can accompany urban decline,
    poverty often shows that a city is functioning well. Cities attract poor
    people because they’re good places for poor people to live.

    Maybe we should be more concerned about the cities where we don't see
    poverty.

    > The absence of poor people in an area is a signal that it lacks something
    important, like affordable housing or public transportation or jobs for the
    least skilled.

    Living in a city is far better for the environment than living in the
    countryside. I've learnt that people are surprised when you tell them this
    and can get offended if they happen to be people who've moved out to a shire
    and think they're saving the planet because they go once a month to an
    organic farmers' market. They drive there in a diesel of course, like they
    drive everywhere.

    What makes a succesful city? The book concludes with the standout example of
    Singapore, which provides a high quality of life and plenty of wealth for
    its citizens without having much in the way of natural resources. The
    drivers are a remarkably competent public sector and decades-long focus on
    education.

    > Education is, after January temperature, the most reliable predictor of
    urban growth.
