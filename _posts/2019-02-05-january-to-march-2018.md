1. _Sapiens_ by Yuval Noah Harari --- A wide-lens look at human history,
   particularly at biology and culture. One of the most interesting arguments is
   that the agricultural revolution promoted huge population growth, and was
   thus successful for the species, but made the lives of individual _homo
   sapiens_ worse than when they had been hunter gatherers. The same claim may
   be made for the industrial revolution. Once such an upheaval has happened,
   there's no way back.
 
2. _Rolling Blackouts_ by Sarah Gladden --- Two youngish American journalists
   tour Turkey, Syria and Iraq, looking for stories. Glidden, the author and
   cartoonist of this graphic novel, tags along to document the trip. So does
   another friend, a former US marine who served in Iraq and has his own view on
   things. It’s poignant to read the stories of Iraqi families who found refuge
   in Syria, realising that in the time since this was written their lives have
   no doubt been in danger and turmoil all over again.
 
3. _Silence_ by Erling Kagge --- Not a deep read, but reminded me that one of
   the great benefits of long distance running or walking is spending time in
   your own head.
 
4. _Everything and More_ by David Foster Wallace --- A history of infinity, in
   particular the work of Georg Cantor. Wallace tries to cut down on the amount
   of repetition in mathematical writing with a lot of abbreviations, but I
   found this slowed down the reading rather than help. The book claims to be
   readable without some background in maths. As in the case of Penrose’s
   _The Road to Reality_ I think even if that were true it would not be a
   fun read. If you've studied some mathematical foundations, I recommend.
 
5. _Seveneves_ by Neal Stephenson --- I’ve long thought if I ever got into
   sci-fi, I’d get into it hard. This might be the book to do it.
   Saying that, the first two of the three parts are the ones I really enjoyed
   and they’re the ones that are set in the near future with some nice thinking
   about orbital mechanics. The third part, the real sci-fi bit, took a while
   for me to see the point of.
 
6. _Janesville_ by Amy Goldstein {% include star.html %} --- The modern history
   of one industrial city in Wisconsin. Janesville was the home of the Parker
   pen company and had the oldest General Motors factory in the US until it
   closed in 2008. The book follows a few of the residents affected by the plant
   closure over the following five years. These characters make concrete the
    problems of deindustrialisation: how tough it to lose the job you
   thought would be for life, how tough it is to retrain, to commute huge
   distances or move when property prices plummet.

7. _12 Rules for Life_ by Jordan B. Peterson --- Like any self-help book,
   there’s some pretty obvious stuff here that could be useful. Useful to me
   maybe. "Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping”, sure.
   Society is full of Pareto distributions, I don't feel this is widely
   understood and Peterson pushes on the idea. Be ready for a lot of Old
   Testament. There’s a weird bit where his example of good parenting is his
   ability to pin down a two year old. Nice one.

8. _Daniels' Running Formula_ by Jack Daniels --- Training plans from 800m to
   marathon with useful details on physiology, nutrition and recovering from
   injuries. The latter became the most important chapter this time as I got
   crocked halfway through a marathon programme.

9. _October_ by China Miéville --- A narrative look at the Russian Revolution
   between February and October 1917. There’s a lot of bureaucracy that is key
   to the story (so many committees) and it’s hard to make that interesting even
   for a storyteller like Miéville. His own politics must be considered,
   including admiration of Lenin, but he’s open about it.

10. _Aurora_ by Melanie Windridge --- This is a combination of a travelogue
    around Canada, Iceland, Scotland, Sweden, Norway (northern parts of the
    world where the auroral oval can be seen) and a pop science explainer.
    Windridge is a plasma physicist and does the explaining well. I thought I
    roughly understood the mechanism: solar wind hits magnetosphere, solar wind
    particles excited. I was close but wrong. 

    Here’s how I understand it after reading the book. Solar wind is plasma with
    a frozen-in magnetic field. The direction of the field can be pointing north
    or south as the sun spins and blasts out coronal mass ejections. When the
    solar wind hits the magnetosphere, the plasma is diverted around the Earth,
    and its frozen-in magnetic field is draped around the magnetosphere. There’s
    a clustering of field lines on the upstream (sun-side) of Earth, 60,000 km
    above the equator. If fields pointing in opposite directions are pushed
    close enough together, the  field plasma can break down and the magnetic
    configuration can change: field lines break and reconnect. There’s tension
    in the plasma, and the reconnection catapults plasma particles away and down
    the field lines. Energy is transferred from the field to the particles as
    they are accelerated to high speed. The particles collide with the upper
    atmosphere and its the atmospheric particles that are excited. So the aurora
    happens at the bottom of the field lines.

    I also learnt which transitions cause the different colours of the aurora
    and why they’re banded by height. Greens and reds are both transitions of
    oxygen. The decay lifetime of the green excitation is around a second, the
    red excitation lifetime is about two minutes. If there’s a collision with
    another molecule before the excited molecule has time to decay, the energy
    will be lost as heat and there won’t be colour emission. So the green
    transition is more common than the red. Also the red aurora tends to appear
    above 200 km (where there are fewer molecules to bump into) and the green
    aurora are lower at around 150 km. Pink and purple colours are due to
    transitions of nitrogen that have much shorter decay times and can be seen
    below 100 km.

11. _A Small Town in Germany_ by John le Carré --- I’ve been meaning to try a le
    Carré book for a while, and was immediately hooked on this one. Something
    between a spy novel and a mystery set in Bonn in the 60s.

12. _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ by Cal Newport {% include star.html %} ---
    'Follow your passion' is terrible advice.
