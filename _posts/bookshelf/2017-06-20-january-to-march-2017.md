## SPQR by Mary Beard

_A History of Ancient Rome_. You can only learn things by attaching them to
what you've already learned, and I hadn't learned much about a thousand years
of Roman history. That said, I got more out of it than expected because Beard's
writing is fun and the book is rarely dry.

One thing I do know about is the wood tablets at the fort of Vindolanda at
Hadrian's Wall, because I've been to see them at the museum there.  When the
first tablets were peeled apart and the ink writing discovered, they were
rushed to the university at Durham but oxidised before they could be
transcribed. The message was thought lost but at the medical school they found
they could still read it in the infrared. And they've been able to protect many
of the rest dug up so you can see them yourself. The tablets include the
oldest surviving writing in Latin by a woman, an invitation to a birthday
party. I recommend a visit.

## The Hunt for Red October by Tom Clancy

I always picture Alec Baldwin as Jack Ryan.

## The Lowland by Jhumpa Lahiri

A sweeping but intimate novel that starts in 1960s Calcutta with two young
brothers, Subhash and Udayan. Their lives fork, an impulsive Udayan caught
up in the Naxalite movement at home and a studious Subhash setting out for
university and a life in New England. It's about staying and leaving, about
parenthood, loss, guilt and responsibility, through four generations of a
family.

## Endurance by Alfred Lansing

_Shackleton's Incredible Voyage_. Lansing wrote this authoritative account of
the Endurance expedition, having got hold of most of the diaries kept on the
voyage and then interviewed the surviving crew. The mission of the great
explorer to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic went awry when the
tallship got stuck in the icepack of the Weddell Sea, was crushed and sank
leaving the crew without a hope.

There's no way to condense the ordeals and suffering the book details. It is
unfathomable that they survived. After all that they'd endured over a year,
Shackleton took a few men in the tiny open boat _James Caird_ and navigated 800
miles over the most deadly ocean on the planet to hit their only hope of
rescue, the speck of South Georgia island. Once there, they had to climb over
the sawtooth mountains and glaciers of the interior to get to the whaling
station, that itself a route nobody had survived attempting. Shackleton
then went back to rescue every one of his crew.

Frank Hurley shot early [colour photographs][hurley] and got the film home. They
are beautiful.

## Ragtime by E.L. Doctorow

> 'Do not play this piece fast. It is never right to play Ragtime fast.'

## The Carter of La Providence by Georges Simenon

_Inspector Maigret #4._ Simenon is great at canals, as most other things.

## The Innovators by Walter Isaacson

_How a Group of Hackers, Geniuses, and Geeks Created the Digital Revolution_. A
history of the people who invented computers, microprocessors, software and the
web, from Ada Lovelace to Larry Page. Each character in the story is met only
briefly, because many people contributed.

And that's really the theme of the book. We still have this notion of looking
for lone genius inventors when in fact innovation since the last century has
driven by brilliant thinkers in collaboration and many incremental
advances.
