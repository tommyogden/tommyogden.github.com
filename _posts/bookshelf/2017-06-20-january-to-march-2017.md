1. _SPQR_ by Mary Beard --- You can only learn things by attaching them to what
   you've already learned, and I hadn't learned much about a thousand years of
   Roman history. That said, I got more out of it than expected because Beard's
   writing is fun and the book is rarely dry.

   One thing I do know about is the wood tablets at the fort of Vindolanda at
   Hadrian's Wall, because I've been to see them at the museum there.  When the
   first tablets were peeled apart and the ink writing discovered, they were
   rushed to the university at Durham but oxidised before they could be
   transcribed. The message was thought lost but at the medical school they
   found they could still read it in the infrared. And they've been able to
   protect many of the rest dug up so you can see them yourself. The tablets
   include the oldest surviving writing in Latin by a woman, an invitation to a
   birthday party. I recommend a visit.

1. _The Hunt for Red October_ by Tom Clancy --- I always picture Jack Ryan as
   Alec Baldwin.

1. _The Lowland_ by Jhumpa Lahiri {% include star.html %} ---  A sweeping but
   intimate novel that starts in 1960s Calcutta with two young brothers, Subhash
   and Udayan. Their lives fork, an impulsive Udayan caught up in the Naxalite
   movement at home and a studious Subhash setting out for university and a life
   in New England. It's about staying and leaving, about parenthood, loss, guilt
   and responsibility, through four generations of a family.

1. _Endurance_ by Alfred Lansing {% include star.html %} --- Lansing wrote this
   authoritative account of the Endurance expedition, having got hold of most of
   the diaries kept on the voyage and then interviewed the surviving crew. The
   mission of the great explorer to make the first land crossing of the
   Antarctic went awry when the tallship got stuck in the icepack of the Weddell
   Sea, was crushed and sank leaving the crew without a hope.

    There's no way to condense the ordeals and suffering the book details. It is
    unfathomable that they survived. After all that they'd endured over a year,
    Shackleton took a few men in the tiny open boat _James Caird_ and navigated 800
    miles over the most deadly ocean on the planet to hit their only hope of
    rescue, the speck of South Georgia island. Once there, they had to climb over
    the sawtooth mountains and glaciers of the interior to get to the whaling
    station, that itself a route nobody had survived attempting. Shackleton
    then went back to rescue every one of his crew.

    Frank Hurley shot early [colour photographs][hurley] and got the film home. They
    are beautiful.

1. _Ragtime_ by E.L. Doctorow

1. The Carter of La Providence by Georges Simenon (Maigret #4) --- Simenon is
   great at writing canals, as most other things.

1. _The Innovators_ by Walter Isaacson --- A history of the people who invented
   computers, microprocessors, software and the web, from Ada Lovelace to Larry
   Page. Each character in the story is met only briefly, because many people
   contributed.

    And that's really the theme of the book. We still have this notion of looking
    for lone genius inventors when in fact innovation since the last century has
    driven by brilliant thinkers in collaboration and many incremental
    advances.
