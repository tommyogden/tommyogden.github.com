1. _Open_ by Andre Agassi --- The interesting thing about Agassi's story is he
   hated his sport. Emmanuel Agassi, an Iranian Olympic boxer migrated to Las
   Vegas, decided his son would be a tennis pro before he was born. Rigged up a
   machine to fire balls at a toddler thousands of times a day and sent him on
   to academies. In Andre's telling, by the time he got to decide what he wanted
   to do, he only had one option. One he didn't want. Even when that job got him
   rich, famous and married to Brooke Shields.

   Only when things fell apart, he got a ban for crystal meth and dropped to the
   bottom did Agassi get to enjoy tennis. The rise from there back to world
   number one late in his career is the real sporting life.

2. _Running with the Kenyans_ by Adharanand Finn --- Finn moves for six months
   to the marathon capital of the world, a town in Kenya called Iten. He
   hopes to find out what makes the locals worldbeaters at distance running.
   Running miles to school every day? Running barefoot? Ugali? Altitude?
   Attitude? And of course it's a bit of all of that. Except the barefoot
   running, Kenyans wear trainers.

3. _Hidden City_ by Karl Whitney --- I got this book about Dublin before
   returning to the city in August, but it's more a book for locals seeking
   out obscure bits of their city. Whitney explores underground rivers, ghost
   towns hit by the financial crash, sewage systems and bus networks. Luckily I
   can happily read about infrastructure all day, I don't know why.

4. _The Green Road_ by Anne Enright --- Picked up from the great Irish fiction
   section of Chapters in Dublin. We have a family on the west coast of Ireland,
   Rosaleen and her children.

   > He did not seem happy, he seemed a bit impatient but, _That is because I am
   well_, Constance thought, I have been wasting his time with my robust good
   health, I have been wasting everyone's time! Her clever body had been doing a
   great job. Complex. Microscopic. Quiet. The map of light that was her left
   breast was not frightful but beautiful, and the marbled black and white of
   its sonic depths was lovely too.

   Constance stays and the others go off: to New York and Mali. We hear the
   separate stories of them, and then they're brought back together.

   > She had not thought it would be dark, not yet, the way the Atlantic sky
   held the light for so long after the sun was down, something to do with the
   height of the heavens out here on the green road. The west was still open and
   clear, but the ground under her feet was tricky enough. All the colour was
   going from things and nothing was easy to see. You could not tell grey from
   grey.

5. _A Crime in Holland_ by Georges Simenon

6. _The Grand Banks Caf√©_ by Georges Simenon
