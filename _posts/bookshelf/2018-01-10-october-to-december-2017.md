1. _The Undercover Economist Strikes Back_ by Tim Harford --- The sequel to his
   tour of microeconomics, this one covers macro, with a bit of the life of Bill
   Phillips and his [MONIAC][moniac] hydraulic computer.

   We learn with a couple of examples about recessions that are a failure of
   supply like the 'prison-camp recession', or a failure of demand like the
   ['babysitter recession'][br], and that in practice it's hard to tell which is
   happening. So in response, short-run Keynes, long-run classical is a rule of
   thumb.

   It then covers inflation, printing money, GDP, and there's a chapter
   explaining how independent central banks committed to low inflation work as
   _Dr Strangelove_-like doomsday devices. Having them should mean we don't have
   to use them, but it was the ECB's device that went off in Greece.

2. _A History of the World_ by Andrew Marr --- I don't know why after _SPQR_
   I've gone for another history book covering such a mad amount of time, but I
   liked the style of Marr's _History of Modern Britain_ so thought I'd like
   this one too. I mean, Marr starts off admitting that 'writing a history of
   the world is a ridiculous thing to do', but that 'not having a sense of world
   history is even more ridiculous', and that's sort of what I was hoping to
   find out --- are there any major histories that I just have no idea
   about?

   The time spent on non-European histories was most useful for me, particularly
   what was going on in China relative to what was happening with Christianity
   and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Also the Americas and Russia. I
   should read some Tolstoy.

   Marr makes no apology for it being a history of 'powerful individuals', but
   doesn't always convince me that someone else would not have come along with
   the same idea. Watt and his steam engine for one example, or Ghandi's Salt
   March. In some cases it is clear that one person moved the world in a certain
   direction, like Zimmermann with his [Telegram][tele], and most significantly
   Genghis Khan.

3. _The Vital Question_ by Nick Lane {% include star.html %} --- Lane takes us
   through a radical, wide-ranging new theory on the origins of life and then
   complex life. The theory puts energy right at the centre of the problem, with
   the sort of derivation from first principles you get in physics. So I enjoyed
   that.

   > The energy we gain from burning food in respiration is used to pump protons
   across a membrane, forming a reservoir on one side of the membrane. The flow
   of protons back from this reservoir can be used to power work in the same way
   as a turbine in a hydroelectric dam.

   It starts with a search for the sort of consistent energy gradients needed to
   kick things off. He rules out lightning (not enough) and UV radiation (too
   destructive), but reveals one candidate on Earth with the right conditions:
   those hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean.

   > Exactly the kind of dissipative structures that we seek: continuous flow,
   far-from-equilibrium electrochemical reactors.

   Once simple life is sorted we find out how, after two billion years with
   nothing but bacteria and archea, eukaryotes (complex life like animals and
   plants) branched off with one extremely rare event when a bacterium got
   inside an archea (the rare thing is that they didn't both immediately die)
   and formed a nucleus with a mitochondria power plant. Why that was so
   revolutionary: single-cell organisms have a limit on how big they can get
   while bringing in enough energy to support themselves, because the energy
   throughput of the membrane is limited by surface area, which increases
   squared as the volume increases cubed.

   The rest of the book takes the idea on to why complex life is like it is:
   sex, ageing, disease, death. There's a lot of biology terms through the book,
   which left me needing the glossary or lost in an argument. He's good at
   recapping though so I stopped being bothered about that, just skipping on to
   catch up.


4. _The Marches_ by Rory Stewart --- A journal of long walks in the borderlands
   between England and Scotland. The first, along Hadrian's Wall, he takes with
   his 89-year-old father, comparing the end of Roman Empire with retreat of
   British Empire, which in the Malayan Civil Service and MI6 his father saw
   firsthand. The second is a meandering walk from Cumbria to Crieffe,
   investigating what it means to live in the middleland, and how firm the
   boundaries really are.

   > While the people hereabouts (and a good way north) have over the past
   > 2,000 years spoken Cumbrian, Welsh, Latin, Northumbrian, Norman French and
   > Borders English, they have never spoken Scottish Gaelic and never called
   > this place Alba.

5. _Grave New World_ by Stephen D. King ---  A look at the retreat of
   globalisation and return of nationalists over the last couple of years, and
   where this could take us.


6. _Killers of the Flower Moon_ by David Grann {% include star.html %} --- This
   is a shocking, tragic crime history from 1920s Oklahoma. The sisters in a
   family of the Osage tribe of Native Americans, mad rich from oil strikes on
   the rocky land they'd been shoved onto, started dying off: poisoned, shot,
   blown up. The surviving family have to pay for the new federal Bureau of
   Investigation to pull together a band to find the murderers and the
   conspiracy protecting them.
