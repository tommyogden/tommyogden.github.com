## Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall 

_Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need to Know About Global Politics_. With
our century's aircraft, internet and supranational institutions, we may be
tempted to think we've overcome the bounds of physical geography in global
affairs. Our history is told in ideologies and leaders, good or bad.

<aside>
'There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural
and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans.' &mdash;Thomas Jefferson
</aside>

Marshall shows us that plains, rivers and mountains are still predominant in ten
examples from around the world with corresponding maps. He explains why Tibet is
important to China, why Russia cares so much about the north European plain, and
why with the Louisiana Purchase complete, the United States was destined to be a
superpower.

He might overstate the case a bit but as I never see this kind of analysis
&mdash; only discussion of what Putin or Trump has said today &mdash; it's a
refreshing way of looking at things. It's a shallow dive but comes with a
decent bibliography to dig in further, which I intend to do.

## Open City by Teju Cole

Open City follows the wandering thoughts of Julius on long walks around
Manhattan. I put it on a reading list about New York I researched before
visiting last October, then bought it from the geographically arranged shelves
of McNally Jackson. So I expect the book will always remind me of that city,
though the story resists ties of place.

<aside>
'And so when I began to go on evening walks last fall, I found Morningside
Heights an easy place from which to set out into the city.'
</aside>

I put it down after a few pages. Nobody thinks like Julius, joining dots between
Bach, Nietzsche, Auden, Mahler. I picked it up again and realised that the
connection of ideas, people, places was the point. We might be at Ground Zero
one moment and the Nigeria of his childhood next, or talking to a Moroccan
writer in a Brussels internet café. We're in Julius' head. That's all novels,
but it's the fluency here that makes it work.

I heard the citizen of the world is a 'citizen of nowhere'. Cole reminds us that
art and people transcend nations. 'I'm on a road to nowhere. [There's a city in
my mind][1].'

## Mindset by Carol Dweck

_How You Can Fulfill Your Potential._ The most obvious criticism you can give
Mindset is that Dweck takes 250 pages to explain a thesis that can be given in
a couple of sentences: We should stop with the old debates of nuture versus
nature, genes versus environment, as research shows a greater indicator of
success is our approach to abilities. In broad strokes: we may have a _fixed
mindset_ and consider our qualities to be set, or a _growth mindset_ and
believe that our qualities can be developed through effort. Guess which works
best.

Importantly, the growth midset itself can be developed. Dweck is a research
psychologist, and cites convincing studies to back up the argument, though none
look at long-term effect. The rest of the book is given to examples from sports
and business and sweeping, mostly obvious advice for applying mindsets to work,
relationships and parenting.

<aside>
'I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26
times, I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've
failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.'
&mdash;Michael Jordan
</aside>

I'll note an example I like: Michael Jordan was no obvious natural talent. He didn't
make his varsity team. He just worked harder than anyone to improve, even when
he'd been the best for so long.

It's such a broad thesis that I suspect it's easy to find examples to back it
and hard to disprove. I'd say the most valuable advice in the book is this:
don't praise children for ability or talent, 'you're so clever' and so on.
You'll leave them fearing eventual failure, that you'll see them turn out not
to be no genius after all and be forever disappointed. Instead praise their
successes for the effort and work that went into them. They'll grow to treat
setbacks like Jordan's missed shots.

## Travels with Charley by John Steinbeck

In 1960, at 58, Steinbeck makes a months-long tour around America with his
French poodle Charley in a modified camper truck. He wants to see what's changed
in the years he's been in Europe and New York. What he finds isn't always
positive: radio's the same everywhere, some hitchhikers are racist. But for the
most part his account of the open road and the the characters he finds on it is
warm.

## My Ántonia by Willa Carther

<aside>
'There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or
fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight.
There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of
which countries are made.'
</aside>

A tough, romantic tale of the immigrant life of early settlers on the Nebraska
plain in the age of the Homestead Act.

Ántonia is a truly well-written character, and Carther is a master at
both people and landscapes.

> 'I was something that lay under the sun and felt it, like the pumpkins, and I
> did not want to be anything more. I was entirely happy. Perhaps we feel like
> that when we die and become a part of something entire, whether it is sun and
> air, or goodness and knowledge. At any rate, that is happiness; to be

> naturally as sleep.'

## Turing's Cathedral by George Dyson

_The Origins of the Digital Universe._  An early history of the Institute for
Advanced Study at Princeton. Dyson has a good perspective from which to tell
this story, as he grew up there while his father Freeman Dyson was a fellow.

<aside> 'In some sort of crude sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no
overstatement can quite extinguish, the physicists have known sin; and this is
a knowledge which they cannot lose.' &mdash;Robert Oppenheimer</aside>

Though it is Turing's name in the title, the book centres on the work of the
Hungarian émigré and polymath John von Neumann to build the general-purpose
ENIAC computer in the years up to 1946. Von Neumann, Teller and other hawks
thought the best route to world peace was a 'preventive' hydrogen bomb strike
on the Soviet Union, and the computer was intended to use their newly-invented
Monte Carlo methods to simulate thermonuclear explosion. Thankfully that bomb
was never dropped, peaceful uses for the computer were found in biology and
meteorology, and the result of the von Neumann architecture is the digital
world we now live in.
