## Capitalism by James Fulcher

A very short introduction. A brief review of capitalism's history, its emergence
in Europe and current global reach. The most interesting chapter for me is the
comparison between different models taken in the United States, Japan and
Sweden. On the latter:

> 'The labour movementâ€™s leadership recognized that welfare depended not just on
> the strength of socialist ideas and working class organization but also on
> the operation of a dynamic capitalist economy that could compete
> internationally and increase the size of the national economic cake. It was
> one of the central principles of Swedish economic policy that unprofitable
> companies should be allowed to go bankrupt, so that their resources could be
> transferred to profitable sectors of the economy. Swedish workers were in
> this respect rather less protected than British workers by government
> interventions to bail out failing companies. Furthermore, the union-controlled 
> labour market policy did not protect jobs but assisted workers to
> become mobile and retrain.'

## The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy 



The second book in the Border Trilogy is a story of three crossings of the Texas
border by the teenaged Billy Parham. The first is a dreamlike journey to return
a wild, pregnant wolf to its Mexican mountain home, the second and third follow
in fate and circumstance.

I can never get enough of McCarthy's runaway sentences and the made-up words
that sound right as soon as you read them: 'the godmade sun', 'the mute and
footsore dog', 'the needlethin sweepsecond hand sectoring the dial'. The best
are often saved for his keen-eyed attention to the animals.

> 'The horse raising its head above the skyline to listen among the
> constellations and then bending to graze again. He studied those worlds
> sprawled in their pale ignitions upon the nameless night.'

## The Secret History by Donna Tartt

Pretty sure if I'd read this novel before 2012 I would not have spent the next
three years living with classicists.
