            <p>Up and packing to leave soon after six o&rsquo;clock on Friday, I was somewhat disheartened to find thick mist outside the zipper. What happened to the clear skies of Thursday? I shook as much water as I could from the outer tent and heaved up my bag to go. The friendly farmer waved &lsquo;bye&rsquo; from a distance across the field, where I surmised he was off to do something farmy in his wellingtons. I shuffled quietly through the village, past the Inn I&rsquo;d visited the night before.</p>
            <p>A stone-walled path carried me gently out of Ribblesdale, and to my delight I suddenly broke through the ceiling of fog, which I now saw blanketed only the sleeping valley. Above this, I strode in fresh, warm daylight; the disc of the sun rising quickly from behind Pen-y-ghent&rsquo;s peak. I could hardly contain the bliss of being such a pretty moment, so quiet and early in the day. I suddenly felt strong and young. That is to say, impossibly fortunate. Such reflections are rarer than they really should be. It was certainly a feeling I wanted to savour; one that made it worth all effort expended.</p>
            <p>Apart from the distant summits, including Ingleborough—the other giant of the area—the views changed little as I progressed through the morning. One or two shadowy holes suggested locations of the caves indicated on the map. Past Cave Hill (there&rsquo;s a clue), I arrived at the head of a deep cut in the limestone, Ling Gill (A). Ancient ash trees (and other old species I don&rsquo;t know the names of) lined the sides of the gorge, steep enough to offer protection from nibbling animals.</p>
            <blockquote><p>&lsquo;Anno 1765 thys bridge was repaired at the charge of the whole of West Rydeing.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>The track met the Cam High Road, a well-trodden Roman route over Cam Fell (B). I gained height gradually, overlooking a vast conifer plantation stretching out to the east, before turning left onto a packhorse trail along the edge of a rounded valley. This was one of those sections I underestimated from the map; it took much longer than I expected to reach the highest point, Ten End. From here, however, the view opened out to Wensleydale and more alluring Dales villages.</p>
            <p>I eventually dropped down and across a few flat fields into Gayle. The Way enters this hamlet via an ugly pebble-dashed housing estate—something of a shock after a day of walking in open country. It quickly leads on to the larger market town of Hawes, where I dropped my bag briefly for a rest. I was beginning to boil in the afternoon sun. I circled the wonky streets forming the centre of the town, looking for somewhere to find supplies in between the many touristy craft shops. I had to pick up some local cheese in Wensleydale, of course. Once stocked up, I set off toward the day&rsquo;s destination: the Green Dragon Inn in Hardraw. This pub has Britain&rsquo;s highest waterfall, Hardraw Force, in its back garden, which I thought would make it a pleasant place to rest for the night.</p>
            <p>I was tired and hungry by the time I got there and set my tent up, and rather churlishly admonished the barman when he told me there was no hot water to wash in. I do still think a fiver is a bit much to charge for a patch of grass if you&rsquo;re not even going to provide a hot water tap. A bath under the falls perhaps? This was where Kevin Costner took a dip for that scene in <em>Robin Hood</em>, so perhaps not out of the question! Other patrons may not have approved. Anyway, I thought the landlord was &lsquo;monetising&rsquo; that waterfall a bit much. Apparently it&rsquo;s two pounds just to have a look at it. It can&rsquo;t exactly take much maintenance.</p>
            <p>The Force is certainly impressive though: a 30m single drop. After checking it out and enjoying my cheese with some bread, I settled down for a late nap. In the evening I went back into the pub to find a cozy seat next to the fire. I spent a while chatting to a sweet couple from St. Helens who were out on their motorbike for the weekend. He wore a Pantera t-shirt and merrily described adventures he&rsquo;d had on his bike; she seemed genuinely excited about camping &lsquo;for the first time&rsquo;. I was starting to get used to it. As it was £3.60 for a pint of bitter (in Yorkshire!) I didn&rsquo;t ask for a second, returning instead to my tent to sip on whisky and listen to the rumbling falls.</p>
