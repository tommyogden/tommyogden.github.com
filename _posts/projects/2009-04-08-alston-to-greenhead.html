description: Pennine Way Day 12, via Whitley Castle and Blenkinsopp Common.
---

<p>Over breakfast at the hostel, I chatted to a couple on my table who were on a
driving and cycling holiday.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;I did the Pennine Way—well, nearly did it—twenty years ago
now. I got to Bellingham and fractured my shin jumping off a
stile.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Ouch! I still had a couple of days walking before Bellingham, so I certainly
wouldn&rsquo;t be jumping off anything before then. I devoured as much breakfast
as I could, including three Weetabix, eggs, veggie sausages, mushrooms, beans,
hash brown and a whole rack of toast with marmalade.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d read that this leg would likely be the dullest of the Pennine Way
but, to be quite honest, I&rsquo;d had quite enough excitement with Cross Fell
the day before so I wasn&rsquo;t too bothered.</p>

<p>The first section followed a road and railway north through the valley of the
South Tyne. On the left slope of the valley, I hopped over stiles through
farmland. The only item of note was Whitley Castle (A), the remains of a Roman
auxiliary fort. I didn&rsquo;t spy it initially, only realising up close that
the narrow undulations near the path were actually the remarkable rhomboid
ramparts of this second-century stopover on the Maiden Way, which connected a
fort on the York–Carlisle road with Carvoran on Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall.</p>

<p>Continuing north, the route took me across the road and under the railway
into Slaggyford. Leaving the river, I passed under a pleasing arched railway
viaduct, through more farms into Knarsdale and joined that old Roman Maiden Way
over Lambley Common.</p>

<p>After Lambley, the route left the road I&rsquo;d followed all morning to head
out over desolate moors. Hartleyburn and Blenkinsopp Commons were big, open
hills and the hike—mile after mile of slow climbing—was tiring. The vague ramble
west eventually brought me to the fence I would follow all the way to to the top
of Blenkinsopp (B).</p>

<p>Eventually, I weaved my way through abandoned mine workings to the noisy A69
road linking Carlisle and Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Unfortunately, the quickest way
into Greenhead was to walk behind the highway barrier, over the service station
fast-food wrappers and cola cans that so many idiots had discarded from their
windows; trying not to breathe in too much lorry exhaust.</p>

<p>Greenhead seemed quite uninteresting. Its main preoccupation seemed to be
with the big road. It was hardly village-like. I fancied a pint but the hotel
didn&rsquo;t look appealing. A campsite was suggested on the map, so I headed
straight for it.</p>

<p>A little old lady, in her seventies or eighties, called from behind me as I
walked up the road; she&rsquo;d seen me walk too far with that big rucksack on.
&lsquo;Are you looking for camping?&rsquo; she asked, in a lovely half-geordie,
half-scottish accent. She led me back to the green lawn behind her pretty house.
&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve not had anyone yet this year, but you&rsquo;re welcome to
stay.&rsquo; We had a short chat about where I&rsquo;d been and where I was off
to next. Bellingham was a long way to go in one day, she thought. As she
hadn&rsquo;t mentioned payment yet, I asked how much it was. She frowned as
though she didn&rsquo;t really want to charge. &lsquo;Oh, three pounds it is
love. My son looks after the camping usually, but he&rsquo;s away just now.
You&rsquo;ll need twenty pence pieces for the shower, do you have any?&rsquo; I
didn&rsquo;t, so she put four in my hand and tottered back into the porch.</p>

<p>I showered, performed my daily replacement of the plasters holding my feet
together and cooked up some couscous as the shadows of tall conifers stretched
long across the grass.</p>
