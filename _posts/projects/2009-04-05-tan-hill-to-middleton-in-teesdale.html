<p>Slumped at the bottom of my tent due to the slope, and by then overfamiliar
with each of the stones that pressed through the groundsheet, I wondered if it
was worth getting up yet. My phone must&rsquo;ve picked up some signal, as I
found a text from my friend Jim: &lsquo;will be at a66 at 8, half eight.&rsquo;
Where was the A66? Why had he written out the second &lsquo;eight&rsquo;? Never
mind, he was on his way! Jim had kindly offered to join me for couple of
days&rsquo; walking, and I was really looking forward to having someone other
than myself to talk to. Jim&rsquo;s always fun to have around.</p>

<p>The A66, Ordnance Survey informed me, was about 11km from where my tent was
perched upon Tan Hill, so I had to get moving. I struggled to hook out the pegs
as my fingers were quickly numbed by the wind. I wanted to move quickly down
Sleightholme Moor—to warm myself up and not to leave Jim waiting in a trunk road
lay by—but it wasn&rsquo;t so easy. The guide warned that it &lsquo;can be a
dangerous place&rsquo;, and offered an alternative road route, but I was keen to
stick to the official trail and visibility was good enough. The danger, I
discovered, lay in tracts of waterlogged peat, into which it&rsquo;s quite
possible to sink deep with a misplaced step. There was little clear path to
follow and where I did find it, it was trodden into murky puddles. I set a
compass bearing and held it as best as I could.</p>

<p>I made reasonable time, and found myself on the path down to God&rsquo;s
bridge, where a brook disappears under a huge slab of limestone before
reappearing again unhindered. And nearby, by the road (A), Jim had just arrived.
I showed him where we were headed on the map and we set off vaguely north across
Bowes Moor.</p>

<p>The trail met and shadowed a dry stone wall for a long while and, not having
to study the compass so much, I prattled on—I hadn&rsquo;t held an extended
conversation with anyone for a week!—and Jim updated me on his York City&rsquo;s
chances of survival in the conference. Reaching the brow at Race Yate Rigg, we
then stomped down Cotherstone Moor (the guide puts it perhaps a bit harshly:
&lsquo;a sweep of featureless waste&rsquo;. I thought it was alright) to the gap
between Blackton Reservoir (B) and the colossal dam wall of Balderhead
Reservoir.</p>

<p>From there we rose uphill through some high, scruffy meadows to a ridge from
where we could see out next port of call, Lunedale, and another pair of
reservoirs. Passing over the bridge between these, we trekked up through a
couple of farms and their scattered barns, to the higher ground around Harter
Fell (C). The eerie circle copse of Kirkcarrion, a Bronze Age burial site, stole
our attention at the top of the hill to the East.</p>

<p>We finally traipsed onto the road into Middleton at about three
o&rsquo;clock. Having already decided that we should drop our bags soon and
scout for a Sunday lunch, we stopped at the first campsite we met on the edge of
town. It featured rows of those dreary green static caravans, but offered a
space for tents. Looking for a reception, I ventured into the campsite
bar/clubroom, which obviously hadn&rsquo;t been decorated this side of 1990. I
waited for a youngster in a Sunderland shirt to swap his coins for Monster Munch
before paying to to pitch Jim&rsquo;s tent: a two or three-manner which seemed
palatial compared to the coffin-sized thing I&rsquo;d been getting used to.</p>

<p>We left quickly to see if we could find somewhere still serving lunch. A
couple of pubs had finished up, but the 1618 café held out for us. Though not
offering a veggie alternative for the lunch, they were very accommodating and
fixed me up a mushroom bake to go with the spuds and vegetables. While we
waited, we read the wonderfully local stories in the pages of the
Mercury—&lsquo;voice of Teesdale since 1854&rsquo;— whose office sat opposite
the café.</p>

<p>Once fed, we wandered over to the Bridge Inn to play a few games of pool. A
young mechanic and his girlfriend sat silently next to the window. Sunday in a
small town. After pool and a game of darts, we set off back to the tent to read
up on Monday&rsquo;s leg, which would be a serious 30km trek. I took the
opportunity to enjoy my first shower in three days. Bliss.</p>
