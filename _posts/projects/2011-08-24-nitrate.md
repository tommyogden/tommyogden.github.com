For the research part of my masters at Stockholm I studied reorientation of the nitrate anion in water. Using computational models we explained a remarkable broken symmetry in the anion's vibrational modes.

## Thesis and Paper

These theoretical studies are described in the following paper and thesis.

## Simulation Video

The following video shows the simulated dynamics of a nitrate anion within a hydration shell.

<aside>For the video, the nitrate anion and a single hydration shell have been 'cut out' from the rest of the water atoms for clarity.</aside>

The water molecules form hydrogen bonds with the nitrate, and the motion of the hydration shell jostles the nitrate. The frames are 50 femtoseconds apart, the whole video simulates ~50 picoseconds.
