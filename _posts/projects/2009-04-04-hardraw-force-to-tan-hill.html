description: Pennine Way Day 8, via Great Shunner Fell, Thwaite and Keld.

<p>I knew it was due to rain on Saturday morning and had hoped to be
packed up before it started. So I cursed when I woke to patters on
the tent not long after five o&rsquo;clock. I had a plan in the
event of a wet start, however. I&rsquo;d spotted a house-build next
to the inn, which had been topped off but not fitted with windows or
doors yet. I got all my stuff together inside the tent (quite
difficult when everything has to be done lying down) and ran my bag
over to drop it in the house. Then I ran back, circled the tent to
pull out all the pegs and carried it over so I could take it down
and sort my waterproofs out under the protection of a roof.</p>

<p>The morning&rsquo;s task was Great Shunner Fell (A) and, boy, was I shunned
by this mountain. The rain continued to pour, the cloud pressed in on me as soon
as I got onto the Fell and the wind only got fiercer as I gained altitude.  The
outside world disappeared entirely and I had no idea how far I&rsquo;d gone or
had to go. My nifty backpack-covering waterproof poncho only served, in these
conditions, as a sail to push me in whichever direction the gales swirled, and
to flap up into my face; so I gave up on it, preferring to get soaked. It took
no little determination to keep going for hour after hour like this; I repeated
&lsquo;HUP! two, three, four…&rsquo; continuously to maintain a pace, and
shouted crazily at myself to keep going.</p>

<p>The summit cairn offered little protection from the elements and no views, of
course, so I continued, northeastward, for more of the same on the descent. As I
neared Thwaite (B) and a return to civilisation, I finally passed somebody: a
southbound Pennine Way walker. He&rsquo;d taken eleven days to get to this
point, which worried me a little as I only had eight days to cover the same
ground. It&rsquo;s curious to meet someone coming the other way—you each hold
the whole trail in your head: part in memory, part in imagination; but you each
have the opposite parts. Your near future is their recent past, and vice versa.
You try to extract information through questions, &lsquo;what are the best and
worst bits to come?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the Cheviot like?&rsquo; and by
examining faces for signs of joy, tiredness or fear when they answer.</p>

<p>Perhaps the strain of Great Shunner showed in mine, because before we carried
on, he said &lsquo;you know, if you take a left on the first road you get to
down there, it&rsquo;ll take you straight to Keld and chop a couple of miles
off.&rsquo; As a measure of my weariness, I began to consider the idea. Reaching
the road, I paused for a moment and compared the directness of the tarmac with
the hike over Kisdon Hill. I carried on—no shortcuts! I soon wondered if
I&rsquo;d regret that decision however, as I got lost on the side of Kisdon.
Finding myself at a dry stone wall with no stile, I realised I was a few contour
lines away from where I needed to be, and so had to track back for a miserable
twenty minutes. On the right path again, I journeyed down through woodland and
over some ankle-testing scree, before stopping for lunch next to a river
crossing at a small waterfall, where the Pennine Way bisects Wainwright&rsquo;s
Coast-to-Coast walk (C).</p>

<p>Here I had to say a fond farewell to the Dales as I entered County Durham.
After an ascent back onto open moorland, I spotted my destination: the
implausibly isolated Tan Hill Inn. Tan Hill is the highest pub in England at
528m above sea level, right on top of a remote moor. I had expected it to be
somewhat quiet (with the significant effort required to get here from anywhere)
but when I arrived, in the afternoon, it was full. I waited at the bar as the
man I presumed to be the landlord served drinks. He was a cheery, middle-aged
chap with spiky hair (dyed bright red), a black wasitcoat and missing front
teeth. A bowler hat later appeared. From the way he bantered with the customers,
I think he&rsquo;d typically be described as &lsquo;a character&rsquo;. I
approved of his swagger in time to the country music on the jukebox. I asked if
I could camp. &lsquo;Of course you can,&rsquo; he exclaimed, and even kindly
offered me a couch to sleep on indoors in the bar lounge. Lovely! &lsquo;The
only thing is, this is a wedding party, and it&rsquo;s likely to keep going late
into the night.&rsquo; The girls next to me confirmed enthusiastically. So that
would be why there were so many smartly-dressed folk then.</p>

<p>I had to consider my options. As much as a comfortable couch in a warm room
appealed, I knew I&rsquo;d be exhausted and would want to be away early in the
morning. I didn&rsquo;t really want to get involved with a wedding. I thanked
him and went to set up my tent outside. For the second time in a day, I wondered
if I&rsquo;d made the right call. Being on top of a broad summit, the wind made
pitching a tent (even a low one like mine) difficult. At first I looked for the
best bit of ground, but the wind just bent the poles flat there. With very
little grace I staggered with the tent across to the biggest boulder I could see
to use it as a break. Unfortunately, the ground here was at an incline, and was
bumpy with stones. What choice did I have? I pitched as near to the boulder as I
could stamp the pegs in, and weighed all the sides down with rocks to stop gusts
from getting underneath.</p>

<p>I scurried back into the pub to sit down and get warm, and worried about my
tent outside. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine&rsquo; said the barman, nodding to the
wind speed meter above the optics. &lsquo;32 miles an hour. We get 50 to 60 here
sometimes.&rsquo; I was less than reassured, and spent the evening wondering if
my tent would get to Kirk Yetholm a few days before me. I&rsquo;d taken up
residence next to the fire to read and, as nobody seemed to be paying any
attention, I poked and stoked it a couple of times to keep it burning. Only when
I stood up to check on my stuff did I realise my work had constituted an
acceptance of responsibility.</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going? You&rsquo;re in
charge of that fire now, son—you&rsquo;d better be keeping an eye on
it.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>So then I had a tent <em>and</em> a fire to worry about.</p>
