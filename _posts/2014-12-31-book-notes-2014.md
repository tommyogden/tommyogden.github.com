1. _Old School_ by Tobias Wolff {% include star.html %} --- In [an
   interview][pr] soon after finishing _Old School_, Wolff suggests Robert Frost
   — who appears in the novel — 'didn’t fully understand his own poem', or
   pretended not to. The theme of a writer's intention comes up both in Frost's
   reading of George's story as a dig at him and Susan's reading of the
   narrator's work as a trick on Hemingway, both unintended. Authentic or fake?
   Fiction or memoir? The writer is morally required to set down the truth, but
   cannot.

   > A more truthful dust-jacket sketch would say that the author, after much
   floundering, went to college and worked like the drones hed once despised,
   kept reasonable hours, learned to be alone in a room, learned to throw stuff
   out, learned to keep gnawing at the same bone until it cracked.
