            <p>The <a href="http://www.visitcumbria.com/kes/the-bowder-stone.htm">Bowder Stone</a> is a massive lump of rock carried along by a glacier and dropped conspicuously up on the valley side. It looks delicately balanced, like a die that landed on its edge. The climbers underneath are planning bouldering routes.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m slowly learning the names of all the different bits of mountaineering gear. Here&rsquo;s my screwgate and nut key.</p>

            <p>This labrador was with a family climbing next to us on the crags. He seemed to have a lot of fun shaking that stick about.</p>
