description: Measure &pi; just by dropping sticks on a table and counting them.

<p>We all learn at school that \( \pi \) is the ratio of a circle&rsquo;s
    circumference to its diameter, but \( \pi \) turns up all over the place in
    mathematics. For example, did you know you can measure \( \pi \) just by
    dropping sticks on a table and counting them? This is because \( \pi \) has a
    role in statistics too. Try it for yourself, and below we&rsquo;ll
    visit the story of how this remarkable trick was discovered.</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th class="one-col">Sticks Dropped</th>
            <th class="one-col">Crossing a Line</th>
            <th class="one-col">Estimate of \( \pi \)</th>
            <th class="one-col">Error</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><span id="stick-count">0</span></td>
            <td><span id="cross-count">0</span></td>
            <td><span id="estimate">0</span></td>
            <td><span id="error-percent">0</span>%</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<aside class="sidebox">
    <form class="side" id="sticks-form">
        <label>Number of sticks to drop:</label>
        <select id="num-sticks-select" size="1">
            <option value="10">10</option>
            <option value="100" selected="selected">100</option>
            <option value="1000">1,000</option>
            <option value="10000">10,000</option>
        </select>
    </form>
    <br />
<!-- </aside> -->

<em>Click on the board!</em> Each time you click, <span
id="num-sticks">100</span> sticks will be dropped and the number that cross a
line will be counted. I dropped 10 to start you off.<br /><br />

Does the estimate get better as you drop more sticks (i.e. does the error get
smaller)? How close to \( \pi \) can you get after 100,000 sticks, or
1,000,000?

<h2>Buffon&rsquo;s Needle</h2>

<p>In 1777, a French philosopher called Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon,
wrote out a very elegant theorem which turned out to be the earliest problem in
geometric probability.</p>

<p>Buffon discovered that if you draw a set of equally-spaced parallel lines
(say, \( d \) centimetres apart) and drop sticks on them which are shorter than
the spacing (say \( l \) centimetres long, where \( l \) is less than \( d \)),
then the probability of a stick crossing a line is \[ \frac{2 l}{\pi d}.\]
</p>

<p>This means that if you drop lots of sticks randomly and count how many cross
the parallel lines, you can calculate what \( \pi \) is by rearranging the
formula:
\[ \pi = \frac{2ls}{c d} \]
where \( s \) is the number of sticks you drop and \( c \) is the number that
crossed a line.</p>

<p>Isn&rsquo;t that remarkable? Buffon had worked out that you can calculate \(
\pi \) just by dropping a bunch of sticks on a table &mdash; no circles
required! The problem is known as Buffon&rsquo;s Needle.</p>

<p>As usual in statistics, we want to take a big sample to get an estimate close
to the true probability. If I ask 5 people &lsquo;are you left handed?&rsquo;
and you ask 500 people the same, we know that your bigger sample is likely to
give us the better idea of what proportion of people are left handed in the
whole country. The same applies here &mdash; to get a good sample we need to
drop a lot of sticks.</p>

<p>Perhaps that&rsquo;s why it took a long time after Buffon&rsquo;s discovery
for somebody to actually try it themselves, but in 1901 the Italian
mathematician Mario Lazzarini gave it a go. He span around and dropped over
3,400 sticks onto the floor, counted up the number that crossed over lines and
estimated \( \pi \) to be 3.1415929. We know \( \pi \) to be 3.1415927&hellip;,
so he was correct in the first 6 digits, an error of 0.000006%. That&rsquo;s
good! Suspiciously good in fact, and so improbable that it&rsquo;s more likely
he cheated. Hoist by his own probabilistic petard?</p>

<h2>Monte Carlo</h2>

<p>What Lazzarini did we would today call a simulation. Simulations have become
vastly easier and more important now that we can use computers to do the legwork
for us. I&rsquo;m sure a dizzy Lazzarini would&rsquo;ve appreciated one.
Simulations like this, where we use randomness (or, usually, pseudo-randomness)
to give us a sample of results, are called Monte Carlo methods, after the
European city famous for its casino.</p>

<p>Monte Carlo methods are very useful in physics, as we can model a large
system with a huge number of possible states with a much smaller, but
representative subset. It has important uses in thermal physics, molecular
modelling, astrophysics and weather forecasting. And, as Buffon showed 200 years
ago, can even be used to calculate \( \pi \).</p>

<p>Finally, Buffon may have been the earliest human to discover this result but
the natural world might have been first. <a

href="http://www.le.ac.uk/bl/ebm3/Mugford.pdf">a fascinating paper that suggests
ants use Buffon&rsquo;s Needle</a> to determine, before initiating an
emigration, if a nest has sufficient area to house their colony.</p>
