Hello, son. You were born one week ago, Christmas Day, a few minutes 
after midnight. For someone so small, you've kept us well occupied.

There's a lot to tell you about, son, but we have some time for that. For now
I'll just pass on a welcome message from Kurt Vonnegut as it's good advice to
get you going.

> Hello babies. Welcome to Earth. It's hot in the summer and cold in the winter.
> It's round and wet and crowded. On the outside, babies, you've got a hundred
> years here. There's only one rule that I know of, babies â€” goddamn it, you've
> got to be kind.
