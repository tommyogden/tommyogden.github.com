<aside>Each second the red circle takes a step left or right with 50/50
probability.</aside>

<p>Imagine you stand on the pavement on your street, flip a coin and take a
step left for heads or a step right for tails. Then repeat. Your movement might
look something like the red circle above, which is moving according to
electronic coin flips made by your computer.</p>

<aside>Your computer is actually generating pseudorandom numbers. A good
introduction to random and pesudorandom numbers can be found in <a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00x9xjb">this epsisode</a> of In Our
Time.</aside>

<p>We call this kind of path a <em>random walk</em> in mathematics, and though
it might not seem like much, random walks prove to be of great use in
modelling complex systems in diverse fields, from financial markets to
animal behaviour. It is also used everywhere in computational physics from the
cosmological to the quantal, but perhaps the most familiar random walk in
physics came in the form of a classical problem so we&rsquo;ll start there.</p>

<h2>Brownian Motion</h2>

<p>In 1827, the Scottish botanist Robert Brown looked through his microscope at
pollen grains suspended in water and noted that they jittered around in a way
he couldn&rsquo;t explain.</p>

<aside>Einstein had a spectacular 1905, coming up with an explanation for the
photoelectric effect (starting the quantum revolution), special relativity and the mass-energy equivalence as
well as giving this explanation of Brownian motion. Each of these four would
be deserving of a Nobel prize. It is known as the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annus_Mirabilis_papers"><em>annus
mirabilis</em></a> (the miracle year). No physicist has felt truly productive ever since.

</aside>

<p>It took until 1905 until a satisfactory answer was provided by Albert
Einstein who brought some statistical methods to the problem, predicting that
the random motion of the pollen grains  was due to water being made up of
molecules, which were continually bumping into the pollen grains. First he
derived a diffusion equation  for the grains, then he showed how to link this to
physically measurable quantities starting with the <em>mean squared
dispacement</em> (MSD), which we&rsquo;ll come back to.</p>

<p>The reality of atoms and molecules was not fully accepted at that time, and
Einstein viewed this model of Brownian motion as a way to give evidence for, or
to falsify, the atomic theory. He wrote
<a href="http://users.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/files/eins_brownian.pdf">
in the paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>If the movement discussed here can actually be observed (together
with the laws relating to it that one would expect to find), then classical
thermodynamics can no longer be looked upon as applicable with precision to
bodies even of dimensions distinguishable in a microscope: an exact
determination of actual atomic dimensions is even possible. On the other hand,
had the prediction of this movement proved to be incorrect, a weighty
argument would be provided against the molecular-kinetic conception of
heat.</blockquote>

<p>Experimental verification of the theory was made a few years later by
<a href="http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1926/perrin-bio.html">Jean
Perrin</a> &mdash; atoms and molecules were here to stay.</p>

<h2>Walking on a Lattice</h2>

<p>To introduce modelling with random walks, we&rsquo;ll go back to the coin toss example we
started with. This is an example of a lattice walk, in this case a 1D
lattice.</p>

<p>We define the walk as a sequence of \(n\) independent integers \(a_n\), each
with equal probability of being either -1 or 1. Then we define the series
\( \{ S_n \} \), where

\[ S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{a_n}, \]

as the random walk. In the simulation below, 100 walks are made with \( n = 20 \)
steps. The final positions of the walkers are recorded in the histogram,
which gives us a starting point for investigating the statistical properties of
the lattice walk. </p>

<aside>Click to start. The walkers move along the
horizontal axis, with their paths being tracked in time on the vertical axis and
their final positions recorded in the histogram.</aside>

<aside>Note that no walkers land on odd
numbers. Why is that?</aside>

<script src="/js/notes/random-walks-1.js"></script>

<p>A number of runs should show that despite each walker taking its own route,
the result of many walkers tends toward the same result: a normal
distribution. I won&rsquo;t derive that distribution here, but fundamentally its
normality is due to the
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CentralLimitTheorem.html">central limit
theorem</a>.</p>

<p>All good, but for any physical system we&rsquo;re trying to model (e.g. Brown&rsquo;s
jittery pollen grains) we need to find something to relate the individual
walkers  to something we can physically observe. The obvious place to start is
the question: how far do the walkers get after a certain time, or \( n \) steps?</p>

<p>The mean value \( \langle a_n \rangle \)  of any single step
is zero, and by addition we find the the mean, or expectation, value of the
walk,

\[ \langle S_n \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{\langle a_i \rangle} = 0. \]

This we might expect, as with each step having equal probability of going either way
the most probable distance travelled after a number of steps will be zero &mdash; back where
the walker started. So in this case the mean displacement is not useful to
us.</p>

<p>Next we might look at the squared distance travelled. This proves more useful
as \( (-1)^2 = 1^2 = 1 \), so \( \langle a_n^2 \rangle = 1. \) Then

\[ \langle S_n^2 \rangle = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{\langle a_i^2 \rangle} +
\sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j \ne i} 2 \langle a_i a_j \rangle = n + 0 = n.\]

So this non-zero <a href="http://www.compsoc.man.ac.uk/~lucky/Democritus/Theory/msd.html">
mean squared displacement</a> gives us a more useful statistical quantity
to work with.</p>

<h2>Measurable Quantities</h2>

<p>In his paper Einstein derived, from basic principles of kinetic theory, a
mean squared displacement that might be expected for a particle subject to
Brownian motion. Describing the motion in terms of a  <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation">diffusion equation</a>,
he showed that the mean squared displacement  \( \langle S(t)^2 \rangle \) of a
particle at a time \( t \) is related linearly  to the <em>diffusion
coefficient</em> \( D \) by

\[ \langle S(t)^2 \rangle = 2 d D t\]

where \( d \) is the number of dimensions in the problem. The diffusion of
particles is something we can observe and measure, so now we have a way to
check the random walks of a model with reality.</p>

<p>In the next simulation, we&rsquo;ll move up to a 2D lattice, where each walker can
move on a plane: up, down, left or right with equal probability. We&rsquo;ll set off 50 walkers,
and keep track of the MSD as we go in a graph.</p>

<p>The equation for the diffusion coefficient above tells us we should expect
the MSD graph to tend to a straight line as we increase the number of
walkers. Then, once the last walker has walked we&rsquo;ll take a line of best fit
through the function from which (by the relation for the diffusion equation
above, with \(d = 2\)) the slope of the line gives us the diffusion coefficient.

<aside>Click to start. The walkers move around the plane randomly.</aside>

<aside>The graph below shows the mean squared distance the walkers have
travelled, against the number of steps taken.</aside>

<aside>Does the MSD function tend toward a straight line? When the walkers are
finished and the trendline is drawn, does it fit the data well?</aside>

<aside>What does the diffusion coefficient tell us about particle motion?</aside>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope I&rsquo;ve given an inkling of how detailed physical models can be based on
something as simple as taking random steps. By making a good choice of random
walks, we can sample huge domains in a systematic way that gives us useful
results, without having to check every possible outcome  (for example, every way
a particle might go). We can then link the theory of microscopic behaviour to
macroscopic observables &mdash; things we can measure in the lab.</p>

<p>One example, Einstein&rsquo;s model of Brownian motion and Perrin&rsquo;s  measurement,
provided crucial evidence for the existence of atoms at the beginning of the
last century, something we take for granted now. But as I mentioned, random
walks are everywhere in physics, playing an important role in what are known as
Monte Carlo simulations. I&rsquo;ll write some more about the use of Monte Carlo
methods in quantum physics in future notes.</p>
