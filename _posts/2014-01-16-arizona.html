<aside>Photos from the Utah part of this trip, <a href="/photos/2014/utah">here</a>.</aside>

<p>In January I attended the <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/itamp/WinterSchool2014.html">ITAMP</a> winter school on ultracold Rydberg physics.
The school was held at <a href="http://b2science.org">Biosphere 2</a>, a unique research facility in the desert not far from Tucson. Following the winter school I took a road trip with two friends, Hannes and Henning, up through Arizona and into Utah.</p>

<h2>Biosphere 2</h2>

<p>The biosphere was built in the early 90s as a closed experiment to determine
what would be needed to set up bases for future space colonisation. Inside the
domes are areas for rainforest, ocean, coral reef, wetlands and desert, with the
idea of creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. Kylie Minogue was <a

there</a>.</p>

<p>Since those 90s missions &mdash; when groups of scientists were locked in for
up to two years at a time &mdash; the centre has been an Earth Sciences research
laboratory.</p>

<p>Our accomodations were these pastel Southwestern-style <em>casitas</em> at the biosphere &mdash; simple, comfortable.</p>

<h2>Roadtrip Arizona</h2>

<p>With the winter school concluded, we picked up a car to drive north through
Arizona and into Utah. Arizona alone is bigger than Britain, so there was a fair
bit of driving to do. The first day we set off from Tucson through Phoenix up 
to Sedona.</p>

<p>We made it to Sedona and climbed up to Airport Vortex just in time to watch the sun set on the great red sandstone rock formations. Sedona is a beautiful
little town with good bars and caf√©s, full of outdoors shops for hiking, cycling and climbing in the surrounding hills and canyons.</p>

<aside>Vortexes not vortices, who knows why.</aside>

<p>Sedona&rsquo;s more unusual feature is that it draws in hippies and new-agers
who believe the rocks contain &lsquo;spritual power centres&rsquo;, with the
local name of <a href="http://www.lovesedona.com/01.htm">&lsquo;energy
vortexes&rsquo;</a>. So there&rsquo;s also shops
peddling every kind of spiritual nonsense: astrology, palm reading, healing
crystals, all that. Even that did little to put me off though, I'd love to go
back.</p>

<p>We left through Oak Creek Canyon on the scenic 89A state road, which makes an ear-popping climb through hairpin turns up to Flagstaff and then beyond on the plateau. Here we&rsquo;re looking back at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak">Humphreys Peak</a>, the highest point in Arizona at 3,852 metres.

<p>The Colorado River continues its age-old work of cutting its way through the Grand Canyon. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocBvVH6SEas">&lsquo;I&rsquo;d echo everything you say&hellip;&rsquo;</a> From here we drove into <a href="/photos/2014/utah">Utah</a>.</p>
