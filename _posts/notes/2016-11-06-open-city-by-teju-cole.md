Open City follows the wandering thoughts of Julius on long walks around
Manhattan. I put it on a reading list about New York I researched before
visiting last October, then bought it from the geographically arranged shelves
of McNally Jackson. So I expect the book will always remind me of that city,
though the story resists ties of place.

I put it down after a few pages. Nobody thinks like Julius, joining dots between
Bach, Nietzsche, Auden, Mahler. I picked it up again and realised that the
connection of ideas, people, places was the point. We might be at Ground Zero
one moment and the Nigeria of his childhood next, or talking to a Moroccan
writer in a Brussels internet cafÃ©. We're in Julius' head. That's all novels,
but it's the fluency here that makes it work.

I heard the citizen of the world is a 'citizen of nowhere'. Cole reminds
us that art and people transcend nations. And flow in the city.
