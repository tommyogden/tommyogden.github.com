The second book in the Border Trilogy is a story of three crossings of the Texas
border by the teenaged Billy Parham. The first is a dreamlike journey to return
a wild, pregnant wolf to its Mexican mountain home, the second and third follow
in fate and circumstance.

I can never get enough of McCarthy's runaway sentences and the made-up words
that sound right as soon as you read them: 'the godmade sun', 'the mute and
footsore dog', 'the needlethin sweepsecond hand sectoring the dial'. The best
are often saved for his keen-eyed attention to the animals.

> constellations and then bending to graze again. He studied those worlds
> sprawled in their pale ignitions upon the nameless night.'
