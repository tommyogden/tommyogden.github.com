In [an interview][pr] soon after finishing _Old School_, Wolff suggests Robert
Frost — who appears in the novel — 'didn’t fully understand his own poem', or
pretended not to. The theme of a writer's intention comes up both in Frost's
reading of George's story as a dig at him and Susan's reading of the narrator's
'work' as a trick on Hemingway, both unintended.

Authentic or fake? Fiction or memoir? The writer is morally required to set down
the truth, but cannot.

> reasonable hours, learned to be alone in a room, learned to throw stuff out,
> learned to keep gnawing at the same bone until it cracked.'
