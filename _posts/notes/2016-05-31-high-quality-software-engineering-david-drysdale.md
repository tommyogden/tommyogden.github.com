description: Lessons from the Six-Nines World
---
 
This free book available from [Drysdale's homepage][0] drew me in with the
perspective  offered in that subhead -- six-nines meaning 99.9999% uptime, or 31
seconds downtime per year. It covers the main areas of software engineering:
design, coding, reviews and testing, and declares three themes:
'maintainability', 'knowing reasons why' and 'developing developers'.

For me the most useful sections were on designing for scale and reliability and
on testing strategies. Not so useful were those on project management, which
felt dated. The list near the back of technical fundamentals that
developers should also understand will serve as a good to-do list for me.
