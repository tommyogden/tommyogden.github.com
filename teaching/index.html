            <h4>2012</h4>

            <h2>Demonstrating: Computing Labs </h2>

            <p>During Michaelmas term I&rsquo;m working in the second year computing workshops, helping students with their programming in Python.</p>

            <h2>Forskarskolan</h2>

            <p>Every year high school students in Stockholm can apply to a two-week science summer school where they work in research groups at Stockholm University. In 2011 I supervised six students in the Quantum Chemistry group, where we assigned projects on properties of molecules and chemical reactions.</p>

            <p>We also demonstrated physics with some fun little experiments, like applying voltage to gherkins to make them glow like streetlights and making icecream with liquid nitrogen. The students also got a chance to visit a particle accelerator and to see the telescope on the roof of the physics building &mdash;  the largest operating optical telescope in Sweden.</p>

            <p>I had been told the students would be motivated &mdash; they were giving up two weeks of summer to be there, and places were competitive &mdash; still I was impressed by how well the students worked and how quickly they picked up ideas. It was a fun two weeks.</p>

            <p>Read more about the summer school on <a href="http://www.physto.se/~odelius/Forskarskola2011.html">the SU website</a> (in Swedish) and watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8r61PRKqTE">a film made about the 2011 school</a>.</p>

            <h2>Celebrate Science</h2>

            <aside class="stamp">October 2011, Durham</aside>

            <p>I was invited to help with our AtMol group&rsquo;s show at the second annual Celebrate Science fair, held on Palace Green in Durham during local schools&rsquo; half term holidays. The festival attracted over 3,500 people over 3 days. On our stand we talked to children and parents about temperature, laser cooling and atomic clocks &mdash; and showed them a real atom cooling experiment we&rsquo;d brought along.</p>

            <h2>A Bit of Quantum Mechanics</h2>

            <p>A presentation I gave to the students of forskarskolan as an introduction to the ideas of the quantised nature of atoms and light, with a little history.</p>
