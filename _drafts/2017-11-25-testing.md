Hello world. Here's a list with paragraphs.

- _Christianity_ by Linda Woodhead --- It's strange when I read histories of
  Christianity having spent my childhood in one branch of it. Things I think I
  know well seen from a different angle. In fact though she covers most
  churches, Woodhead doesn't mention JWs. Most interesting in this brief review
  was to read about the early divide in church versus biblical Christianity.
  Also the role of mystical Christianity and the Catholic church's successful
  absorption of the monastic movement to bring it under its own control.

- _Deep Work_ by Cal Newport --- This book felt important, and I just counted
  the number of passages I've added to my notes from it:  94, which is maybe a
  record. I'll pick out a couple.

  > The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly
  the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a
  consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of
  their working life, will thrive.

Here's a basic list.

Blah blah blah. Here's a numbered list.
