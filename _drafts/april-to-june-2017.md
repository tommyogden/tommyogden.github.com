## Deep Work by Cal Newport

## The Yellow Dog by Georges Simenon

## Cities of the Plain by Cormac McCarthy

## The Spanish Civil War by Helen Graham

## Men Without Women by Ernest Hemingway

This second collection of stories was published in 1927. _Hills Like White
Elephants_ and _The Killers_ are maybe the most celebrated of all his stories.
All fourteen are distilled so the story flows in the gaps, and you know he's
reporting life where he's seen it, whether bullfights in _The Undefeated_,
boxing in _Fifty Grand_ or war on the Italian Front in _Now I Lay Me_ and _In
Another Country_.

In a 1950 [New Yorker interview][0]:

> "I can remember feeling so awful about the first war that I couldn’t write
> about it for ten years," he said, suddenly very angry. "The wound combat makes
> in you, as a writer, is a very slow-healing one. I wrote three stories about
> it in the old days—'In Another Country,' 'A Way You’ll Never Be,' and 'Now I
> Lay Me.'"
