## SPQR by Mary Beard

_A History of Ancient Rome_. You can only learn things by attaching them to
what you've already learned, and I hadn't learned much about a thousand years
of Roman history. That said, I got more out of it than expected because Beard's
writing is fun and the book is rarely dry.

One thing I do know about is the wood tablets at the fort of Vindolanda at
Hadrian's Wall, because I've been to see them at the museum there.  When the
first tablets were peeled apart and the inked writing discovered, they were
rushed to the university at Durham but oxidised before they could be
transcribed. They thought they'd lost the message forever, but at the medical
school they found they could still read them in infrared. And they've been able
to protect many of the rest they dug up so you can see them yourself. The
tablets include the oldest surviving writing in Latin by a woman, an invitation
to a birthday party. I strongly recommend a visit.

## Endurance by Alfred Lansing

_Shackleton's Incredible Voyage_. Lansing wrote this authoritative account of
the Endurance expedition, having got hold of most of the diaries kept on the
voyage and then interviewed the surviving crew. The goal of the great explorer
to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic went awry when the great ship
got stuck in the icepack of the Wedell Sea, was crushed and sank leaving the
crew without a hope.

There's no way to condense the ordeals and suffering the book details. It is
unfathomable that they survived. After all that they'd endured over a year,
Shackleton took a few men in the tiny open boat _James Caird_ and navigated 800
miles over the most deadly ocean on the planet to hit their only hope of
rescue, the speck of South Georgia island. Once there, they had to climb over
the huge mountains and glaciers of the interior to get to the whaling station,
that itself a route nobody had ever survived attempting. Shackleton then went
back to rescue every single one of his crew.

Frank Hurley shot early colour photographs and got the film home. They are
beautiful.
