I put this one on a reading list of novels about New York I made before visiting
last October, and bought it from the fine, geographically arranged shelves of
McNally Jackson. Centred as it is on the thoughts of Julius during long walks
around Manhattan, it'll stay connected to the city for me. But the book resists
being tied to one place.

> 'And so when I began to go on evening walks last fall, I found Morningside
> Heights an easy place from which to set out into the city.'

I put it down after a few pages. Nobody thinks like Julius, joining dots between
Bach, Nietzsche, Auden, Mahler. I picked it up again and realised that the
connection of ideas, people, places was the point. It flows around time and
space. We might be at Ground Zero one moment and the Nigeria of his childhood
next, or talking to a Moroccan writer in a Brussels internet café. We're in
Julius' head. That's all novels, but it's the fluency here that makes it work.

I heard it said the 'citizen of the world is a citizen of nowhere.' Cole reminds
us that art, ideas and people transcend nations. And flow freely in the open
city.
