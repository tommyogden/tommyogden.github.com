1. _The Big Sleep_ by Raymond Chandler --- The first Philip Marlowe book. I
   have to write 'hardboiled' here.
  
2.  _I, Robot_ by Peter Crouch --- Bought for the title.

3. _Stories of the Law and How It's Broken_ by The Secret Barrister --- In 2018
   I spent two weeks as a juror on a trial. Welcoming us, the judge said
   something to the effect of 'this system isn't perfect but it's the best we've
   found.' The anonymous author here describes the many ways the neglected and
   underfunded criminal justice system in England is far from perfect.
<!-- 
   Something unmentioned that stuck with me from my experience is how
   clearly the random selection of a jury can effect the outcome and the process
   of deliberation. -->

4. _Green River, Running Red_ by Ann Rule ---

5. _Life Undercover_ by Amaryllis Fox --- 

6. _A Tale of Two Cities_ by Charles Dickens --- Think about what it would have
    been like to read the tale the way it was first published in weekly
    installments, like an HBO series pulling its story arcs together for an epic
    finale. Dickens pulling subscribers into his new publishing startup. The
    least Dickensian of his novels for its shift of weight from character to
    plot.

    'Recalled to life.' For a book with among the most famous first and last
    lines of any written, the note handed to the banker on the Dover mail coach
    tells us most of what it's about. Hope and resurrection form a thin line
    between humanity and terror.
     
    > A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted
    > to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn
    > consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those
    > darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every
    > one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the
    > hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a
    > secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death
    > itself, is referable to this.
  
7. _The Snow Leopard Project_ by Alex Dehgan --- A report from the ground on
   wildlife conservation in the warzones of Afghanistan.
  
8. _Russian History_ by Geoffrey Hosking --- It's interesting to consider how
   much the political history of Russia is affected by its geography: a uniquely
   vast place much of which has hostile climate, diverse in people. This is a
   short introduction.
  
9. _A Line in the Sand_ by James Barr --- A stroke of pen on a map with
   long-lasting effect, in 1916 Sykes and Picot partitioned the territories of
   the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East between the empires of Britain and
   France. Barr sources declassified archives to tell the inglorious colonialist
   history through the decades that followed.

10. _The Idea of the Brain_ by Matthew Cobb {% include star.html %} --- An
    enlightening history of our understanding of probably the most complex and
    inscrutible object we know of. The book combines a chronicle of ideas since
    Aristotle and a tour of the current state of neuroscience.

    I suppose my prior conception of the brain would be a naturally evolved
    computer that allows organisms to control physical functions, learn and
    respond to the environment. Cobb makes a clear argument that the computer is
    just the latest in a line of metaphors based on the technology of the day:
    mechanical clockwork, hydraulic automaton, telephone exchange and on. The
    brain _computes_ but it is not much like a digital computer. It is
    electrochemical and analogue. Localising functions to particular parts of
    the brain is mostly not possible.

    I tend to credit physics for pushing much of 20th century progress in
    computing. That notion is countered here in the influence of neuroscience
    from the 40s, with Alan Turing's test and John von Neumann's interest in
    how neural circuits might encode information, to the 80s, with the work of
    Geoffrey Hinton _et al._ on backpropagation and the Perceptron.[^crick] Thus
    especially recommended if you are interested in machine learning.

11. _Feet of Clay_ by Terry Pratchett {% include reread.html %} --- At 13, my
    English teacher noticed I wasn’t reading any fiction. Given time to read in
    school I’d head for a world atlas. At home I read a lot but mostly bible
    study.[^jw] Mrs Clarke clearly had a good eye for what might catch my
    interest and wrote 'Terry Pratchett' in my schoolbook with homework to find
    a novel of his in the library and report back on it.

    The one I found was _Moving Pictures_ and I’d never read anything like it. I
    went back to the library for the first Discworld book, then the second. My
    mum worked in a WH Smith shop and told me there was going to be a new book
    in the series called _Feet of Clay_. This was exciting, I had not considered
    there would be new ones. She ordered it for me and then through _Hogfather_,
    _Jingo_, _The Last Continent_, _Carpe Jugulum_ and _The Fifth Elephant_ I
    bought each paperback when it came out.

    > And, while it was regarded as pretty good evidence of criminality to be
    > living in a slum, for some reason owning a whole street of them merely got
    > you invited to the very best social occasions.

12. _The Warmth of Other Suns_ by Isabel Wilkerson {% include star.html %} --- A
    narrative history of the Great Migration of African Americans from the
    Southern US to Northern and West Coast cities in the twentieth century,
    pushed by Jim Crow oppression and terror in the South and pulled by demand
    for factory labour in the North.

    > They did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have
    often done. They left.

    The book stands out both for its broad analysis and for its deeply
    researched detail on the three life stories that carry it along. Ida Mae
    Brandon Gladney left Mississippi in the 30s to work blue-collar jobs in
    Chicago. George Swanson Starling left Florida in the 40s for New York City
    and worked as a porter travelling up and down that same route. Robert Joseph
    Pershing Foster left Louisiana for Los Angeles in the 50s to work as a
    doctor. Ray Charles, a patient, praised him in song.

    These destinations were not random but determined by railway tracks.
    Migrants from Florida and Georgia took the coastal route up to Boston and
    New York. Those from Alabama and Mississippi followed the river up to the
    Midwest cities of Detroit and Chicago. Those from Texas and Louisiana took
    the trains west to Los Angeles and Oakland. Their exodus took them from the
    enforced poverty, brutality and segregation of their old rural lives but
    each of course met prejudice and hostility in their new homes.  
 
13. _At Home_ by Bill Bryson --- 

14. _Brit(ish)_ by Afua Hirsch --- ’Where are you from?’ Hirsch calls this The
    Question, asked of her repeatedly with the felt implication that what the
    questioner wants to know is ‘Where are you _really_ from?’ This gave me
    pause because it’s a question I often ask people I meet as an opening for
    them to talk. I would say I don’t care what the answer is, it might be
    ‘right here’ or more than one place[^1], but directly asking about identity
    is not neutral. I’ve been thinking about something else to ask.

    The book is good on analysis of the intersection of race, class and poverty
    in Britain. I don't think the memoir is as useful as far as being
    representative. As Hirsch tells it she grew up in leafy west London, was
    privately educated, went up to Oxford to read PPE, on to be a
    barrister and then a broadsheet journalist. There’s not much more
    institution than that. 

    It's also good in describing Britain’s post-imperial identity crisis. Part
    of it is in the attempt to be a post-racial society without actually coming
    to terms with the racial society we have been and still are. That process is
    difficult --- as the reaction to the sinking of the slaver statue in Bristol
    has shown --- but necessary. I take visitors to Manchester past Lincoln
    Square and talk about the mill workers who refused to work slave-picked
    cotton but when I'm walking past the grand Victorian buildings I don’t
    think about how much textile industry innovation and wealth had been built
    on that slave labour.
 
15. _My Name is Why_ by Lemn Sissay --- the two things I knew about Sissay
    before reading this are that he wrote the poem I often run past on the side
    of [Hardy's Well][hardys] in Rusholme, and that he is the current chancellor
    of the University of Manchester. This memoir covers his childhood from when
    his mother, a young Ethiopian student, was placed in a 'Home for Unmarried
    Mothers' in Wigan. Sissay was taken against her will by social services who
    took away his name and story, renaming him Norman. It's a story of cruel
    institutions that were supposed to care for him and didn't. 

16. _Open Borders_ by Bryan Caplan and Zach Weinersmith --- George Mason
    University economist Caplan teams up with [SMBC cartoonist
    Weinersmith][smbc] to make the case for rich countries to allow free
    migration, including untapped trillions in potential wealth as well as moral
    imperative. Caplan takes strong opposing arguments and rebuts them carefully
    and persuasively. But then I live in a city and already see migration as
    overwhelmingly positive. The arguments focus on economic rather than
    cultural outcomes, which I think people who are less welcoming of migration
    tend to be more concerned about. The illustration lightens up what could be
    dry economic arguments and shows how, done as well as this, graphic
    nonfiction can be a brilliant way to present ideas.

17. _The New Jim Crow_ by Michelle Alexander ---

18. _The Sum of the People_ by Andrew Whitby {% include star.html %} ---

19. _Jingo_ by Terry Pratchett {% include reread.html %} --- After the years I
    spent buried in Discworld books, I went off to university to pick up other
    interests and affectations like 'serious' literature and cardigans. In my
    30s I’m returning to my teenage enjoyment of fun books and parkas.

    > It was so much easier to blame it on Them. It was bleakly depressing to
    > think that They were Us. If it was Them, then nothing was anyone's fault.
    > If it was Us, what did that make Me? After all, I'm one of Us. I must be.
    > I've certainly never thought of myself as one of Them. _No one_ ever
    > thinks of themselves as one of Them. We're always one of Us. It's Them
    > that do the bad things.

[^1]: I don’t have a consistent answer myself.

[^jw]: Jehovah’s Witnesses are in part a print publishing organisation, distributing books, magazines and tracts for evangelism but also to be studied by members.

[^crick]: I had no idea that Francis Crick had been involved in the latter project.
