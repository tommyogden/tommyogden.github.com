3. _Stories of the Law and How It's Broken_ by The Secret Barrister ---

4. _Green River, Running Red_ by Ann Rule ---

5. _Life Undercover_ by Amaryllis Fox --- 

6. _A Tale of Two Cities_ by Charles Dickens --- Think about what it would have
    been like to read the tale the way it was first published in weekly
    installments, like an HBO series pulling its story arcs together for an epic
    finale. Dickens pulling subscribers into his new publishing startup. The
    least Dickensian of his novels for its shift of weight from character to
    plot.

    'Recalled to life.' For a book with among the most famous first and last
    lines of any written, the note handed to the banker on the Dover mail coach
    tells us most of what it's about. Hope and resurrection form a thin line
    between humanity and terror.

    > consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those
    > darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every
    > one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the
    > hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a
    > secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death
    > itself, is referable to this.

11. _The Warmth of Other Suns_ by Isabel Wilkerson {% include star.html %} --- A
    narrative history of the Great Migration of African Americans from the
    Southern US to Northern and West Coast cities in the twentieth century,
    pushed by Jim Crow oppression and terror in the South and pulled by demand
    for factory labour in the North.

    > They did what human beings looking for freedom, throughout history, have
    often done. They left.

    The book stands out both for its broad analysis and for its deeply
    researched detail on the three life stories that carry it along. Ida Mae
    Brandon Gladney left Mississippi in the 30s to work blue-collar jobs in
    Chicago. George Swanson Starling left Florida in the 40s for New York City
    and worked as a porter travelling up and down that same route. Robert Joseph
    Pershing Foster left Louisiana for Los Angeles in the 50s to work as a
    doctor. Ray Charles, a patient, praised him in song.

    These destinations were not random but determined by railway tracks.
    Migrants from Florida and Georgia took the coastal route up to Boston and
    New York. Those from Alabama and Mississippi followed the river up to the
    Midwest cities of Detroit and Chicago. Those from Texas and Louisiana took
    the trains west to Los Angeles and Oakland. Their exodus took them from the
    enforced poverty, brutality and segregation of their old rural lives but
    each of course met prejudice and hostility in their new homes.  
 
12. _At Home_ by Bill Bryson

13. _Brit(ish)_ by Afua Hirsch --- ’Where are you from?’ Hirsch calls this The
    Question, asked of her repeatedly with the felt implication that what the
    questioner wants to know is ‘Where are you _really_ from?’ This gave me
    pause because it’s a question I often ask people I meet as a way of
    creating a connection, an opening for them to talk. I would say I don’t care
    what the answer is, it might be ‘right here’ or more than one place[^1]. But
    directly asking about identity is not neutral. I’ve been thinking about
    something else to ask, maybe ‘Where do you call home?’ or something else
    entirely.

    The book is good on analysis of the intersection of race, class and poverty
    in Britain. I don't think the memoir is as useful as far as being
    representative. As Hirsch tells it she grew up in leafy west London, was
    privately educated, went up to Oxford[^2] to read PPE, on to be a
    barrister and then a broadsheet journalist. There’s not much more
    institution than that. I would like to read the story of her partner, who
    grew up without such advantages in Tottenham and also made it to the Inns
    of Court.

    It's also good in describing Britain’s post-imperial identity crisis. Part
    of it is in the attempt to be a post-racial society without actually coming
    to terms with the racial society we have been and still are. I take visitors
    to Manchester past Lincoln Square and talk about the mill workers who
    refused to work slave-picked cotton. But when I'm walking past the grand
    Victorian buildings I don’t think about how much textile industry innovation
    and wealth had been built on that slave labour. That process is difficult
    --- as the reaction to the sinking of the slaver statue in Bristol has shown
    --- but necessary.
