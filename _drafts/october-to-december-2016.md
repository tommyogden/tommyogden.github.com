## Prisoners of Geography by Tim Marshall 

With our century's aircraft, internet and supranational institutions, we may be
tempted to think we've overcome the bounds of physical geography in global
affairs. Our history is told in ideologies and leaders, good or bad.

Marshall shows us that plains, rivers and mountains are still predominant in ten
examples from around the world with corresponding maps. He explains why Tibet is
so important to China, why Russia cares so much about the north European plain,
and why with the Louisiana Purchase complete, the United States was destined to
be a superpower.

> 'There is on the globe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural
and habitual enemy. It is New Orleans.' &mdash;Thomas Jefferson

He might overstate the case a bit but as I never see this kind of analysis
&mdash; only discussion of what Putin or Trump has said today &mdash; it's a
refreshing way of looking at things. It's shallow but comes with a
decent bibliography to dig in further, which I intend to do.

## Open City by Teju Cole

> 'And so when I began to go on evening walks last fall, I found Morningside
> Heights an easy place from which to set out into the city.'

Open City follows the wandering thoughts of Julius on long walks around
Manhattan. I put it on a reading list about New York I researched before
visiting last October, then bought it from the geographically arranged shelves
of McNally Jackson. So I expect the book will always remind me of that city,
though the story resists ties of place.

I put it down after a few pages. Nobody thinks like Julius, joining dots between
Bach, Nietzsche, Auden, Mahler. I picked it up again and realised that the
connection of ideas, people, places was the point. We might be at Ground Zero
one moment and the Nigeria of his childhood next, or talking to a Moroccan
writer in a Brussels internet caf√©. We're in Julius' head. That's all novels,
but it's the fluency here that makes it work.

I heard the citizen of the world is a 'citizen of nowhere'. Cole reminds us that
art and people transcend nations. 'I'm on a road to nowhere. [There's a city in
my mind][1].'

## Travels with Charley by John Steinbeck

In 1960, at 58, Steinbeck makes a months-long tour around America with his
French poodle Charley in a modified camper truck. He wants to see what's changed
in the years he's been in Europe and New York. What he finds isn't always
positive: radio's the same everywhere, some hitchhikers are racist. But for the
most part his account of the open road and the the characters he finds on it is
warm.
