                <h4>2012</h4>
                
                <h2>Atom-Light Interactions in a Blockaded Medium</h2>
                
                <p class="description">A first year PhD report on theoretical and computational studies of light propagation through an ensemble of three-level ladder atoms, involving electromagnetically induced transparency and long-range dipole-dipole interaction between Rydberg states leading to blockade. Such systems provide a means of controlling interactions between photons for applications in quantum information such as single photon sources, quantum gates and quantum storage.</p>
                
                <h4>2011</h4>

                <h2>Reorientation Dynamics of Nitrate in Water</h2>
            
                <p class="description">My master of science thesis in Computational Physics at Stockholms Universitet. This computational study aims to support recent experimental evidence of frequency dependence in the reorientation of nitrate in water and provide a direct molecular picture of the mechanisms involved.</p>
