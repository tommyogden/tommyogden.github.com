                    <h1>On Places</h1>

                </header>
          
                            <p>Not having visited any of the small towns and villages listed in the Pennine Way itinerary, I read out the pleasing-sounding name of each mysterious destination with equal weight.</p>
            <blockquote><p>&lsquo;Crowden, Gargrave, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Forest-in-Teesdale, Twice Brewed, Steel Rigg, Kirk Yetholm…&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>On reaching and exploring each of these settlements, however, I discovered that some places are, well, less of a place than others. As I reported back by telephone &lsquo;well, it&rsquo;s not really anything. There&rsquo;s F all here.&rsquo;, I started to think about a criteria I would use in my ignorant, townie way to define a &lsquo;place&rsquo;.</p>
            <p>I&rsquo;m so obviously townie, of course. I&rsquo;m used to living in the city centre of Manchester, with 24-hour shops, pubs, cloud WiFi and the security of never being more than 100m from a café and a newspaper. Two weeks in the remotest parts of England was always going to feel a bit different. Those more used to living in the countryside will scoff at how mollycoddled I am—and they&rsquo;d be right to. But there&rsquo;s some things I think a &lsquo;place&rsquo; should have as well as a name, and it&rsquo;s the absence of these things that has helped me decide what they are. For example, I rocked up to Dufton only to discover that the friendly-sounding Stag Inn was closed (presumably because it was a Monday), as was the Village Stores (reasons unknown) so that my only option that evening was to lie in my tent listening to the rain.</p>
            <p>So here&rsquo;s my criteria: to be a real place, I should be able to buy basic groceries like bread, milk and eggs until 10 O&rsquo;clo— no, let&rsquo;s make it easier, 8 O&rsquo;clock in the evening; and there should be a public house in which I can sit somewhere warm and drink beer. Does that seem reasonable? This means that Crowden, Ponden, Dufton and Byrness are not places. Malham, Horton-in-Ribblesdale, Middleton-in-Teesdale, Gargrave, Bellingham and Alston are all places. The latter three get extra points as their shops were lovely Co-ops.</p>
