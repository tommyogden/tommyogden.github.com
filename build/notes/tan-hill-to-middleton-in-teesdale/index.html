            <p>Slumped at the bottom of my tent due to the slope, and by then overfamiliar with each of the stones that pressed through the groundsheet, I wondered if it was worth getting up yet. My phone must&rsquo;ve picked up some signal, as I found a text from my friend Jim: &lsquo;will be at a66 at 8, half eight.&rsquo; Where was the A66? Why had he written out the second &lsquo;eight&rsquo;? Never mind, he was on his way! Jim had kindly offered to join me for couple of days&rsquo; walking, and I was really looking forward to having someone other than myself to talk to. Jim&rsquo;s always fun to have around.</p>
            <p>The A66, Ordnance Survey informed me, was about 11km from where my tent was perched upon Tan Hill, so I had to get moving. I struggled to hook out the pegs as my fingers were quickly numbed by the wind. I wanted to move quickly down Sleightholme Moor—to warm myself up and not to leave Jim waiting in a trunk road lay by—but it wasn&rsquo;t so easy. The guide warned that it &lsquo;can be a dangerous place&rsquo;, and offered an alternative road route, but I was keen to stick to the official trail and visibility was good enough. The danger, I discovered, lay in tracts of waterlogged peat, into which it&rsquo;s quite possible to sink deep with a misplaced step. There was little clear path to follow and where I did find it, it was trodden into murky puddles. I set a compass bearing and held it as best as I could.</p>
            <p>I made reasonable time, and found myself on the path down to God&rsquo;s bridge, where a brook disappears under a huge slab of limestone before reappearing again unhindered. And nearby, by the road (A), Jim had just arrived. I showed him where we were headed on the map and we set off vaguely north across Bowes Moor.</p>
            <p>The trail met and shadowed a dry stone wall for a long while and, not having to study the compass so much, I prattled on—I hadn&rsquo;t held an extended conversation with anyone for a week!—and Jim updated me on his York City&rsquo;s chances of survival in the conference. Reaching the brow at Race Yate Rigg, we then stomped down Cotherstone Moor (the guide puts it perhaps a bit harshly: &lsquo;a sweep of featureless waste&rsquo;. I thought it was alright) to the gap between Blackton Reservoir (B) and the colossal dam wall of Balderhead Reservoir.</p>
            <p>From there we rose uphill through some high, scruffy meadows to a ridge from where we could see out next port of call, Lunedale, and another pair of reservoirs. Passing over the bridge between these, we trekked up through a couple of farms and their scattered barns, to the higher ground around Harter Fell (C). The eerie circle copse of Kirkcarrion, a Bronze Age burial site, stole our attention at the top of the hill to the East.</p>
            <p>We finally traipsed onto the road into Middleton at about three o&rsquo;clock. Having already decided that we should drop our bags soon and scout for a Sunday lunch, we stopped at the first campsite we met on the edge of town. It featured rows of those dreary green static caravans, but offered a space for tents. Looking for a reception, I ventured into the campsite bar/clubroom, which obviously hadn&rsquo;t been decorated this side of 1990. I waited for a youngster in a Sunderland shirt to swap his coins for Monster Munch before paying to to pitch Jim&rsquo;s tent: a two or three-manner which seemed palatial compared to the coffin-sized thing I&rsquo;d been getting used to.</p>
            <p>We left quickly to see if we could find somewhere still serving lunch. A couple of pubs had finished up, but the 1618 café held out for us. Though not offering a veggie alternative for the lunch, they were very accommodating and fixed me up a mushroom bake to go with the spuds and vegetables. While we waited, we read the wonderfully local stories in the pages of the Mercury—&lsquo;voice of Teesdale since 1854&rsquo;— whose office sat opposite the café.</p>
            <p>Once fed, we wandered over to the Bridge Inn to play a few games of pool. A young mechanic and his girlfriend sat silently next to the window. Sunday in a small town. After pool and a game of darts, we set off back to the tent to read up on Monday&rsquo;s leg, which would be a serious 30km trek. I took the opportunity to enjoy my first shower in three days. Bliss.</p>
