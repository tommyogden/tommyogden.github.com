            <p>I knew it was due to rain on Saturday morning and had hoped to be packed up before it started. So I cursed when I woke to patters on the tent not long after five o&rsquo;clock. I had a plan in the event of a wet start, however. I&rsquo;d spotted a house-build next to the inn, which had been topped off but not fitted with windows or doors yet. I got all my stuff together inside the tent (quite difficult when everything has to be done lying down) and ran my bag over to drop it in the house. Then I ran back, circled the tent to pull out all the pegs and carried it over so I could take it down and sort my waterproofs out under the protection of a roof.</p>
            <p>The morning&rsquo;s task was Great Shunner Fell (A) and, boy, was I shunned by this mountain. The rain continued to pour, the cloud pressed in on me as soon as I got onto the Fell and the wind only got fiercer as I gained altitude.  The outside world disappeared entirely and I had no idea how far I&rsquo;d gone or had to go. My nifty backpack-covering waterproof poncho only served, in these conditions, as a sail to push me in whichever direction the gales swirled, and to flap up into my face; so I gave up on it, preferring to get soaked. It took no little determination to keep going for hour after hour like this; I repeated &lsquo;HUP! two, three, four…&rsquo; continuously to maintain a pace, and shouted crazily at myself to keep going.</p>
            <blockquote><p>&lsquo;Stop being scared, you girl. That&rsquo;s a bit sexist. Yeah, but there&rsquo;s only you here. Okay, just don&rsquo;t write it in the journal.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>The summit cairn offered little protection from the elements and no views, of course, so I continued, northeastward, for more of the same on the descent. As I neared Thwaite (B) and a return to civilisation, I finally passed somebody: a southbound Pennine Way walker. He&rsquo;d taken eleven days to get to this point, which worried me a little as I only had eight days to cover the same ground. It&rsquo;s curious to meet someone coming the other way—you each hold the whole trail in your head: part in memory, part in imagination; but you each have the opposite parts. Your near future is their recent past, and vice versa. You try to extract information through questions, &lsquo;what are the best and worst bits to come?&rsquo;, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the Cheviot like?&rsquo; and by examining faces for signs of joy, tiredness or fear when they answer.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the strain of Great Shunner showed in mine, because before we carried on, he said &lsquo;you know, if you take a left on the first road you get to down there, it&rsquo;ll take you straight to Keld and chop a couple of miles off.&rsquo; As a measure of my weariness, I began to consider the idea. Reaching the road, I paused for a moment and compared the directness of the tarmac with the hike over Kisdon Hill. I carried on—no shortcuts! I soon wondered if I&rsquo;d regret that decision however, as I got lost on the side of Kisdon. Finding myself at a dry stone wall with no stile, I realised I was a few contour lines away from where I needed to be, and so had to track back for a miserable twenty minutes. On the right path again, I journeyed down through woodland and over some ankle-testing scree, before stopping for lunch next to a river crossing at a small waterfall, where the Pennine Way bisects Wainwright&rsquo;s Coast-to-Coast walk (C).</p>
            <p>Here I had to say a fond farewell to the Dales as I entered County Durham. After an ascent back onto open moorland, I spotted my destination: the implausibly isolated Tan Hill Inn. Tan Hill is the highest pub in England at 528m above sea level, right on top of a remote moor. I had expected it to be somewhat quiet (with the significant effort required to get here from anywhere) but when I arrived, in the afternoon, it was full. I waited at the bar as the man I presumed to be the landlord served drinks. He was a cheery, middle-aged chap with spiky hair (dyed bright red), a black wasitcoat and missing front teeth. A bowler hat later appeared. From the way he bantered with the customers, I think he&rsquo;d typically be described as &lsquo;a character&rsquo;. I approved of his swagger in time to the country music on the jukebox. I asked if I could camp. &lsquo;Of course you can,&rsquo; he exclaimed, and even kindly offered me a couch to sleep on indoors in the bar lounge. Lovely! &lsquo;The only thing is, this is a wedding party, and it&rsquo;s likely to keep going late into the night.&rsquo; The girls next to me confirmed enthusiastically. So that would be why there were so many smartly-dressed folk then.</p>
            <p>I had to consider my options. As much as a comfortable couch in a warm room appealed, I knew I&rsquo;d be exhausted and would want to be away early in the morning. I didn&rsquo;t really want to get involved with a wedding. I thanked him and went to set up my tent outside. For the second time in a day, I wondered if I&rsquo;d made the right call. Being on top of a broad summit, the wind made pitching a tent (even a low one like mine) difficult. At first I looked for the best bit of ground, but the wind just bent the poles flat there. With very little grace I staggered with the tent across to the biggest boulder I could see to use it as a break. Unfortunately, the ground here was at an incline, and was bumpy with stones. What choice did I have? I pitched as near to the boulder as I could stamp the pegs in, and weighed all the sides down with rocks to stop gusts from getting underneath.</p>
            <p>I scurried back into the pub to sit down and get warm, and worried about my tent outside. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll be fine&rsquo; said the barman, nodding to the wind speed meter above the optics. &lsquo;32 miles an hour. We get 50 to 60 here sometimes.&rsquo; I was less than reassured, and spent the evening wondering if my tent would get to Kirk Yetholm a few days before me. I&rsquo;d taken up residence next to the fire to read and, as nobody seemed to be paying any attention, I poked and stoked it a couple of times to keep it burning. Only when I stood up to check on my stuff did I realise my work had constituted an acceptance of responsibility.</p>
            <blockquote><p>&lsquo;Where do you think you&rsquo;re going? You&rsquo;re in charge of that fire now, son—you&rsquo;d better be keeping an eye on it.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
            <p>So then I had a tent <em>and</em> a fire to worry about.</p>
