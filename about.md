Hi, I&rsquo;m a Data Scientist and Software Engineer living in Manchester,
England. I did a PhD in Theoretical Physics at
[Durham](http://www.durham.ac.uk/), working in the [Joint Quantum
Centre](http://www.jqc.org.uk).

Before that I studied Maths and Physics at Warwick and Computational Physics at
Stockholm. I was born in north Wales. I enjoy distance running, moutaineering
and kayaking.
