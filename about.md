Hi, I&rsquo;m Tommy Ogden. I'm a Data Scientist, Software Engineer and
Theoretical Physicist.

I did my PhD in Theoretical Physics at [Durham](http://www.durham.ac.uk/),
working in the [Joint Quantum Centre](http://www.jqc.org.uk).

<!-- My areas of research are atomic physics and quantum optics. I look at how we might use atoms and light to control quantum information. -->

Born in north Wales, home is Manchester and I spent two years living in
Stockholm, Sweden. I enjoy distance running, moutaineering and kayaking.
