I'm a computational scientist --- my interest is solving problems on the leading
edge of high-performance scientific computing and machine learning. 

I'm currently a Research Data Scientist at
[Dunnhumby](https://www.dunnhumby.com), where I work on the machine learning,
optimisation and forecasting algorithms used by many of the worldâ€™s largest
retailers to model demand for their products and provide the intelligence behind
their pricing and promotion strategies.

Before that I was a researcher in theoretical physics. My PhD was on the topics
of quantum optics and quantum information.
