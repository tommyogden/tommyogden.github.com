<h1>About</h1>

Hi, I&rsquo;m a Data Scientist and Software Engineer living in Manchester. I did
a PhD in Theoretical Physics at [Durham](http://www.durham.ac.uk/), working in
the [Joint Quantum Centre](http://www.jqc.org.uk).

Before that I studied Maths and Physics at Warwick and Computational Physics at
Stockholm. I was born in north Wales. I enjoy distance running, moutaineering
and kayaking.
